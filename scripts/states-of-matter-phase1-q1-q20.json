    "solution": "Here is how to represent particles in each state (using circles to represent particles):\n\n**SOLID**:\n```\n[Diagram: Circles touching in a regular grid pattern, like: ● ● ●\n                                                           ● ● ●\n                                                           ● ● ●]\n```\n- **Spacing**: Particles touching or very close together (tightly packed)\n- **Arrangement**: Regular, organized pattern (like a grid or checkerboard)\n- **Movement**: Only vibration shown (could use small arrows showing vibration)\n\n**LIQUID**:\n```\n[Diagram: Circles touching but randomly arranged, like:  ●  ●●\n                                                        ● ●  ●\n                                                         ●● ● ]\n```\n- **Spacing**: Still close together, particles touching\n- **Arrangement**: Random, irregular pattern (no organization)\n- **Movement**: Could show arrows pointing in different directions (sliding)\n\n**GAS**:\n```\n[Diagram: Circles far apart with lots of space, like:  ●\n                                                            \n                                                               ●\n                                                         ●           ● ]\n```\n- **Spacing**: Far apart with lots of empty space between particles\n- **Arrangement**: Random, scattered throughout space\n- **Movement**: Long arrows in all directions showing fast, free movement\n\n**Key Differences**:\n1. **Spacing increases**: Solid (touching) → Liquid (touching) → Gas (far apart)\n2. **Order decreases**: Solid (regular pattern) → Liquid (random) → Gas (random, spread out)\n3. **Movement freedom increases**: Solid (vibrate only) → Liquid (slide) → Gas (move freely)",
