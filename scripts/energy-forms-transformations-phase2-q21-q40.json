As the roller coaster loses gravitational potential energy, it gains an equal amount of kinetic energy (ignoring friction).\n\nThis is why roller coasters can go fast without engines - they use the energy stored by being lifted high at the start!",

Pulling back the bowstring**:\n- Archer does **work** using their muscles\n- **Chemical PE** (from food in muscles) → **Elastic PE** (in bent bow)\n- Energy is **stored** in the bent bow and stretched string\n\n**2. Releasing the arrow** (at the moment of release):\n- **Elastic PE** → **Kinetic energy**\n- The bow springs back to its original shape\n- This stored energy is transferred to the arrow\n- Arrow **accelerates** rapidly forward\n\n**3. Arrow in flight**:\n- Arrow has **kinetic energy** (moving fast)\n- As arrow rises (if fired upward): Some KE → **Gravitational PE**\n- Air resistance transforms some energy to **heat** (friction with air)\n- Arrow makes a **whooshing sound** (some KE → sound energy)\n\n**4. Arrow hits target**:\n- **Kinetic energy** → Multiple forms:\n  - **Sound energy** (thud of impact)\n  - **Heat energy** (friction as arrow penetrates)\n  - **Work** (pushing aside target material)\n  - Target and arrow may **vibrate** (kinetic energy)\n\n**Complete energy chain**:\nChemical PE (muscles) → Elastic PE (bow) → Kinetic energy (arrow) → Heat + Sound + Work (impact)\n\n**Key insights**:\n- Energy is **conserved** throughout - it transforms but isn't lost\n- The bow acts as an **energy storage device**\n- Not all energy goes into the arrow - some is lost to heat and sound during each transformation",

    "stem": "A roller coaster designer wants the coaster cars to reach 90 km/h at the bottom of the first drop. Explain, using energy concepts, why making the first hill taller would help achieve this speed.",
    "solution": "Making the first hill taller helps achieve higher speed because of **energy transformation** principles:\n\n**How height relates to speed:**\n\n**1. Taller hill = More gravitational PE**:\n- GPE = m × g × **h**\n- Greater height (h) = more GPE stored\n- The **taller** the hill, the more **energy available** for transformation\n\n**2. More GPE = More kinetic energy possible**:\n- As the car descends: GPE → **Kinetic energy**\n- All the gravitational PE can transform into kinetic energy\n- More initial GPE = more final kinetic energy = **higher speed**\n\n**3. Speed depends on kinetic energy**:\n- KE = ½ × m × v²\n- More kinetic energy = higher velocity (v)\n- To reach 90 km/h requires a specific amount of kinetic energy\n- This requires a corresponding amount of initial GPE\n\n**Why a taller hill works:**\n\n**Energy perspective:**\n- **Taller hill** → More GPE at top\n- More GPE → More energy available for transformation\n- More energy → Higher kinetic energy at bottom\n- Higher KE → **Faster speed** (could reach 90 km/h)\n\n**Shorter hill problem:**\n- **Shorter hill** → Less GPE at top\n- Less initial energy means less final kinetic energy\n- Result: Lower maximum speed (might only reach 60 km/h)\n\n**Real-world considerations:**\n- Some energy **lost to friction** (heat) and air resistance\n- Designer must make hill **even taller** than ideal to account for losses\n- This is why the first hill is usually the **tallest** on a roller coaster\n\n**Key principle:** To achieve a target speed, you need sufficient **gravitational potential energy** at the start. Since GPE depends on height (GPE = mgh), increasing the hill height directly increases the energy available to become speed at the bottom.\n\nThe taller the hill, the more energy stored, the faster the car can go!",
