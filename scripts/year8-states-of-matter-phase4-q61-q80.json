    "solution": "The claim is **partially correct but incomplete**.\n\nAt **absolute zero** (0 Kelvin or -273.15°C), particles would have **minimum kinetic energy** and their motion would be as close to stopped as theoretically possible. However:\n\n1. **Quantum mechanics** suggests particles retain some minimal vibrational energy even at absolute zero (zero-point energy)\n2. **State changes would occur first**: Before reaching absolute zero, the gas would undergo **condensation** (gas → liquid) and then **freezing** (liquid → solid) as thermal energy decreases\n3. **In the solid state** at extremely low temperatures, particles would still vibrate slightly in fixed positions, though the vibration amplitude would be extremely small\n\nThe claim addresses **misconception m10** - while particles slow down dramatically, they don't completely stop. Additionally, the substance would have changed state long before approaching absolute zero, making this a theoretical rather than practical scenario.",

Even though particles are moving slower, the dramatic reduction in external pressure allows the balloon to expand. The helium particles spread out to occupy more volume as there is less resistance from outside.\n\nEventually, if the balloon rises high enough, the expansion may exceed the balloon material's stretching capacity, causing it to burst.\n\n**Key concept**: This demonstrates that **both temperature and external pressure** affect gas volume.

    "solution": "**Explanation for younger sibling:**\n\nThe energy doesn't disappear - **energy can never be created or destroyed**, only **transferred** or **transformed**. Here's what happens:\n\n**During freezing:**\n\n1. **Energy transfer**: When water freezes, it **releases thermal energy** to its surroundings (the freezer, the air, or your hand if you touch it). The water particles lose **kinetic energy** as they slow down and lock into fixed positions in ice.\n\n2. **Where the energy goes**: \n   - The thermal energy moves from the water into the colder surroundings\n   - The surroundings (like the air in your freezer) absorb this energy, though the temperature change might be too small to notice\n   - This energy transfer continues until the water reaches 0°C and fully freezes\n\n**Why ice feels cold:**\n\nIce feels cold because **energy flows from you to the ice**, not because ice somehow \"gives you coldness\":\n\n1. Your hand is warmer (about 37°C) than ice (0°C or below)\n2. **Thermal energy flows from warm to cold** - so energy transfers **from your hand to the ice**\n3. Your hand **loses thermal energy**, which your nerves detect as feeling cold\n4. The ice **gains thermal energy**, which eventually causes it to melt\n\n**Key concept**: \"Cold\" isn't a thing that moves - it's the **absence of thermal energy**. When we feel cold, we're really sensing our body losing thermal energy to cooler surroundings.\n\n**Energy is conserved**: The thermal energy lost by water during freezing equals the thermal energy gained by the surroundings. The total amount of energy in the system stays the same.",

    "solution": "**Evaluation of student's explanation:**\n\nThe student's explanation is **incorrect**. The particles don't break down into smaller particles - **naphthalene molecules remain intact** throughout the process.\n\n**What actually happens:**\n\nThe mothballs undergo **sublimation** - changing directly from solid to gas without passing through a liquid phase:\n\n1. **Initial state**: Naphthalene particles in the solid mothball are arranged in a regular pattern, vibrating in fixed positions.\n\n2. **Sublimation process**: \n   - Particles at the surface gain enough **thermal energy** from the room to overcome forces holding them in place\n   - These particles increase their **kinetic energy** and break free from the solid structure\n   - They become **gas particles** (naphthalene vapour) that move rapidly away into the air\n   - This happens continuously at the surface\n\n3. **Why we can't see them**: \n   - Gas particles are **spread far apart** with huge spaces between them\n   - Individual molecules are far too small to see\n   - The **same naphthalene particles** that made up the visible solid are now dispersed throughout the closet as invisible gas\n\n4. **Result**: Over time, all the naphthalene particles sublimate and disperse into the air.

Tilt the glass slightly while submerged and observe\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- Water doesn't fill the glass completely - it stays lower inside than outside\n- Air bubbles escape when you tilt the glass\n- Water then rises to fill the space where air was\n\n**How this supports particle theory:**\n- The air inside the glass is made of **particles that occupy space**\n- Water cannot enter because **air particles are already filling that space**\n- When air escapes (bubbles), water replaces it, showing that space was occupied\n- Even though invisible, air particles prevent water from occupying the same space\n\n**Method 2: Syringe with Blocked End**\n\nProcedure:\n1. Draw air into a syringe\n2. Block the open end with your finger or a cap\n3. Try to push the plunger in to compress the air\n4. Observe the resistance and what happens when you release pressure\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The plunger resists being pushed in - you feel pushback\n- You can compress the air slightly, but with increasing difficulty\n- When released, the plunger springs back to original position\n\n**How this supports particle theory:**\n- Air particles occupy space and resist **compression**\n- The resistance you feel is from air particles pushing back as you force them closer together\n- Air particles can be pushed closer (gas is compressible) but they still take up space\n- The spring-back shows particles pushing apart when pressure is released\n\n**Key Concept Demonstrated:**\nBoth experiments show that air, though invisible, is made of **particles that occupy space** and exert forces.

Normal atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa) represents enormous force from air particle collisions\n3. We don't usually notice atmospheric pressure because it's balanced by equal pressure from inside our bodies and containers\n4.

They don't change chemically - they just become surrounded by water molecules.\n\n2. **Interaction with taste receptors**: \n   - Huge numbers of dissolved salt or sugar particles encounter **taste receptor cells** on your tongue\n   - The **shape and chemical properties** of these particles fit into specific receptor proteins\n   - This is like a key fitting into a lock\n\n3. **Signal generation**:\n   - When many particles bind to receptors, they trigger **chemical signals** in the receptor cells\n   - These cells send **electrical signals** to your brain via nerves\n   - Your brain **interprets** these signals as 'salty' or 'sweet'\n\n**Why taste is an emergent property:**\n\n- **Individual particles** have shape and chemical properties but not 'taste'\n- **Taste emerges** from the interaction of billions of particles with biological systems (receptors, nerves, brain)\n- The sensation of 'salty' or 'sweet' only exists in the **perception of an organism**, not in the particles themselves\n- A single salt particle cannot be salty any more than a single gold atom can be shiny (recall question 69)\n\n**Analogy**: A key has a certain shape, but it's not 'unlocking' until it interacts with a lock. Similarly, salt particles have properties that interact with receptors, but they're not 'salty' until that interaction occurs and is interpreted by a brain.\n\n**Key concept**: Observable properties like taste, smell, colour, and texture are **emergent properties** that arise from interactions between collections of particles and our sensory systems - they are not properties of individual particles themselves.",

    "solution": "**Part a) Why nitrogen dissolves at depth but forms bubbles when ascending quickly:**\n\n**At depth (high pressure):**\n\n1. **High water pressure**: The weight of water above creates enormous pressure. At 30m depth, pressure is about 4 times atmospheric pressure.\n\n2. **Nitrogen dissolution**: \n   - High pressure **forces nitrogen particles** from breathing air into blood and body tissues\n   - Nitrogen gas particles become **dispersed throughout** the liquid blood\n   - The particles remain **spread out individually** as dissolved gas\n   - High external pressure keeps particles **separated** and prevents them from clustering\n\n3. **Particle perspective**: External pressure from water pushes on all sides, keeping gas particles compressed and unable to form bubbles\n\n**Quick ascent (rapid pressure decrease):**\n\n1. **Pressure drops rapidly**: As diver rises quickly, water pressure decreases dramatically\n\n2. **Bubble formation**:\n   - Dissolved nitrogen particles suddenly experience **much less external pressure**\n   - Without pressure keeping them separated, nitrogen particles **move together** to form **gas bubbles**\n   - These bubbles can grow as more nitrogen particles join them\n   - Bubbles in blood vessels and tissues cause pain and tissue damage\n\n3. **Why this is dangerous**: It's similar to opening a soda bottle (see below for comparison) - dissolved gas rapidly becomes bubbles when pressure drops\n\n**Part b) Why ascending slowly prevents this:**\n\n**Gradual pressure decrease:**\n\n1. **Slow pressure change**: Pressure decreases gradually rather than suddenly\n\n2. **Time for elimination**: \n   - Dissolved nitrogen particles can **gradually move** into lungs\n   - The nitrogen is **breathed out** as gas before bubbles can form in blood\n   - Blood circulation brings nitrogen to lungs at a steady rate\n\n3. **Controlled release**: Nitrogen leaves the body as individual particles through normal breathing rather than forming dangerous bubbles\n\n**Comparison to everyday phenomenon:**\n\nThis is similar to opening a carbonated drink:\n- **Sealed bottle (high pressure)**: CO₂ stays dissolved\n- **Quick open**: Pressure drops fast, bubbles form rapidly (fizzing, overflow)\n- **Slow release**: Gradually releasing pressure allows gas to escape without violent bubble formation\n\n**Key concepts:**\n1. **High pressure** keeps gas particles dissolved by preventing them from clustering\n2. **Rapid pressure decrease** allows particles to suddenly form bubbles\n3. **Gradual pressure changes** allow time for gas to be eliminated through normal processes\n4.

    "solution": "**Sample explanation for Year 6 students:**\n\n**Why do puddles dry up on sunny days?**\n\nHave you noticed that puddles disappear on sunny days, even when no one mops them up? Let me explain the science behind this using particle theory.\n\n**What is water made of?**\n\nWater is made of tiny particles called molecules - so tiny that you'd need billions of them to make a single drop! These particles are **always moving**. In a puddle (liquid water), the particles slide and tumble past each other like people in a crowded room.\n\n**How does the Sun help puddles dry?**\n\nWhen the Sun shines on a puddle, it provides **thermal energy** (heat energy). Here's what happens:\n\n1. **Energy absorption**: Water particles in the puddle **absorb** thermal energy from the sunlight\n\n2. **Faster movement**: This extra energy makes the particles **move faster** - they have more **kinetic energy** (movement energy)\n\n3. **Escape from the surface**: Particles at the surface of the puddle that are moving very fast can **break free** from the liquid and zoom off into the air as **water vapour** (water in gas form)\n\n4. **Invisible gas**: Once in the air, water particles spread far apart and become invisible - you can't see them anymore, but they're still there!\n\n**Where does the water go?**\n\nThe water doesn't disappear - it **changes from liquid to gas** (this is called **evaporation**). The water particles are now mixed throughout the air around you. They're the same water particles, just spread out so far apart that you can't see them as liquid anymore.\n\n**Think of it this way:**\n\nImagine a playground full of students (water particles in the puddle). When the bell rings for lunch (Sun provides energy), students get excited and move faster. The fastest students at the edges run off to the cafeteria (evaporate into the air). Eventually, the playground empties as more students leave - the puddle dries up!\n\n**The science in one sentence:**\n\nPuddles dry up because **thermal energy from the Sun gives water particles enough kinetic energy to escape from the liquid and spread out as invisible water vapour in the air**.\n\n---\n\n**What makes this explanation effective:**\n\n1. **Appropriate vocabulary**: Uses key terms (particles, thermal energy, kinetic energy, evaporation, water vapour) but explains them in context\n\n2. **Particle focus**: Clearly describes what happens to particles - they absorb energy, move faster, and escape into air\n\n3. **Energy role**: Explains that thermal energy from Sun causes the change by increasing kinetic energy\n\n4. **Engaging elements**: Uses analogy (playground), asks questions, connects to observable experience\n\n5. **Scientifically accurate**: Correctly describes evaporation as a state change where particles remain the same but change behavior and spacing",

If the substance absorbs **a lot of energy** during state changes (melting or boiling) with **small temperature increases**, this indicates **strong interparticle forces**. Much energy is needed to break these forces and allow particles to change from vibrating in place → sliding past each other → moving independently. This is similar to water, which has strong hydrogen bonds requiring significant energy to overcome during melting and boiling."

    "solution": "The answer is **B**.\n\n**Understanding the observation:**\n\nThe key phrase is: \"absorb a lot of thermal energy **without large temperature increases** during state changes.\"\n\n**What this means:**\n\nDuring state changes (solid → liquid or liquid → gas):\n\n1. **Temperature stays relatively constant** even as thermal energy is added\n2. **Energy is not increasing particle speed** (which would increase temperature)\n3. **Energy is being used** to overcome forces between particles and change their arrangement\n\n**What this tells us about the substance:**\n\n**Strong interparticle forces:**\n\nIf a **large amount** of energy is needed during state changes, the forces between particles must be **very strong**:\n\n- **Melting (-50°C to 0°C)**: Lots of energy needed to overcome forces holding particles in rigid positions, allowing them to slide past each other\n- **Boiling (0°C to 80°C)**: Lots of energy needed to overcome forces keeping particles close together, allowing them to move far apart\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- **Weak forces** (like helium): Little energy needed for state changes, low melting/boiling points\n- **Strong forces** (like water or this alien substance): Large amounts of energy needed for state changes\n\n**Key concept:**\n\nThe amount of energy absorbed during state changes (called latent heat) tells us about the **strength of forces between particles**. Strong forces require more energy to overcome, resulting in:\n- High energy absorption during melting and boiling\n- Temperature remaining relatively stable during these phase changes as energy breaks bonds rather than increasing particle speed\n\nThis demonstrates the fundamental principle that **both kinetic energy (temperature) and potential energy (arrangement/forces) matter** in understanding states of matter.",
