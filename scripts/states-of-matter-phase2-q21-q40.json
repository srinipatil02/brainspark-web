    "solution": "**Any ONE of the following explanations would be correct:**\n\n---\n\n**Option 1: Ice melting quickly**\n\nThe 40°C air has particles with high kinetic energy. When these fast-moving air particles collide with the ice, they transfer thermal energy to the ice particles. The ice particles gain energy and vibrate faster. When they have enough energy, they break free from their fixed positions and become liquid water. At 40°C, this happens very quickly because there's a large temperature difference (40°C - 0°C = 40°C difference) driving rapid energy transfer.\n\n---\n\n**Option 2: Hot sand**\n\nThe sun's energy is absorbed by sand particles, increasing their kinetic energy (they vibrate faster). Sand is a good absorber of heat and doesn't transfer heat well internally, so surface particles become extremely energetic. When your foot touches the sand, these high-energy sand particles collide with your skin particles, rapidly transferring thermal energy and causing the burning sensation.\n\n---\n\n**Option 3: Sea breeze**\n\nWater has high heat capacity - its particles can absorb lots of energy without temperature rising much. The ocean stays cooler than the land. Air particles above the cool ocean have lower kinetic energy than air particles above hot land. Cool ocean air (lower-energy particles) moves in to replace rising hot land air (higher-energy particles), creating a breeze.",
