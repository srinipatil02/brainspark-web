      "solution": "Both are solids because **each individual particle (grain) has a fixed shape**. The difference is:\n\n**Metal cube**: All particles are bonded together into one piece, so the whole object maintains its shape.\n\n**Sand**: Individual grains are separate solids that can move relative to each other (like marbles in a jar), so the collection of grains flows and takes the container's shape. But each grain itself is still a solid with fixed shape.\n\nThe key is that we classify matter based on particle behavior, and each sand grain has particles in fixed positions.",
