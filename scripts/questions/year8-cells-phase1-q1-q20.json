All living things are made of one or more cells\n2. The cell is the basic unit of life\n3. All cells come from pre-existing cells\n\n**Why this is important:**\n\n- **Unifying principle**: Cell theory shows that ALL living organisms - from tiny bacteria to giant whales - share a common structure and origin. This demonstrates that all life is connected.\n\n- **Understanding life processes**: By studying cells, we can understand how ALL living things function, grow, reproduce, and respond to their environment.\n\n- **Medical advances**: Understanding cells has led to breakthroughs in medicine, including how diseases work, how to develop treatments, and how bodies heal.\n\n- **Research foundation**: Cell theory guides all biological research - when we study life, we study cells.\n\nWithout cell theory, we wouldn't understand what makes something \"alive\" or how life continues from generation to generation.
