Over millions of years, this sand could become **sandstone**, a sedimentary rock.\n\nUsing what you know about sedimentary rock formation, explain how beach sand could transform into solid sandstone rock.\n\nInclude these processes in your answer:\n- Deposition\n- Compaction\n- Cementation",
    "solution": "Beach sand can transform into **sandstone** through the following process:\n\n**1. Deposition:**\n- The **sand particles** (sediments) on the beach get washed into the ocean by waves\n- They **settle** on the ocean floor in layers\n- More and more sand accumulates over time, building up thick layers\n\n**2. Compaction:**\n- As more sediment layers pile on top, the **weight** of the upper layers presses down on the lower layers\n- This pressure **squeezes the sand grains** closer together\n- **Water and air** between the grains get forced out\n- The layers become more tightly packed\n\n**3. Cementation:**\n- **Minerals dissolved in water** (like silica or calcite) flow between the sand grains\n- These minerals **crystallize** and act like **natural glue**\n- They **bind the sand grains together**, creating solid rock\n\n**Result:**\nWhat started as loose beach sand is now **sandstone** - a hard, solid sedimentary rock. This process takes **millions of years** to complete.\n\nYou can often see the **original sand grains** in sandstone, and it may still have visible **layers** showing how the sediments were deposited.",

    "stem": "**Sandstone** is a sedimentary rock made of sand grains that have been compacted and cemented together. When subjected to extreme heat and pressure, sandstone transforms into **quartzite**, a metamorphic rock.\n\nExplain how sandstone transforms into quartzite. In your answer:\n- Describe what causes the transformation\n- Explain what happens to the sand grains\n- State whether the rock melts during this process",
    "solution": "**Sandstone transforms into quartzite through metamorphism:**\n\n**What causes the transformation:**\n- Sandstone is buried deep underground (several kilometers)\n- It is subjected to **intense heat** (temperatures of 150-800°C)\n- It experiences **high pressure** from the weight of overlying rocks or from tectonic forces\n- These conditions are found at **convergent plate boundaries** or near **magma intrusions**\n\n**What happens to the sand grains:**\n- The original sand grains in sandstone are made of **quartz** (SiO₂)\n- Under heat and pressure, the quartz grains **recrystallize**\n- The grains **grow larger** and **fuse together** with interlocking crystals\n- The cement between grains is replaced by new quartz growth\n- The boundaries between original grains become **less distinct**\n- The result is a **denser, harder rock** with tightly interlocked quartz crystals\n\n**Does the rock melt?**\n- **No**, the rock remains **solid** throughout the transformation\n- The minerals rearrange in the **solid state** through recrystallization\n- If the rock melted, it would become magma and eventually form an igneous rock, not quartzite\n\n**Summary:**\nQuartzite forms when sandstone is transformed by heat and pressure deep underground. The quartz grains recrystallize and fuse together while remaining solid, creating a much harder and denser metamorphic rock.",
