The drastic change in appearance and properties is evidence that a **chemical change** has occurred, creating a new substance.",

Pure gold is found on the periodic table and cannot be broken down into simpler substances.

Evidence:\n- The salt **dissolves** in water but doesn't bond with it\n- Each substance **keeps its properties** (salt is still salty, water is still water)\n- It can be **separated by physical methods** like evaporation\n- The ratio of salt to water can vary (not fixed)\n\n---\n\n**Sample C: Table salt (NaCl) - COMPOUND**\n\n**Reasoning:** Sodium chloride is a **compound** because it contains **two types of atoms** - sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) - that are **chemically bonded** together. Evidence:\n- The formula NaCl shows chemical bonding between sodium and chlorine\n- It has **different properties** from pure sodium (a soft, reactive metal) and pure chlorine (a poisonous gas)\n- The atoms are in a **fixed ratio** (1:1)\n- It requires **chemical reactions** to separate into sodium and chlorine\n\nThis shows how the same substance (salt) can exist as a pure compound (NaCl) or as part of a mixture (salt water).",
