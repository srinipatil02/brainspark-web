    "solution": "This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nThe book does have energy - specifically **gravitational potential energy (GPE)**. Even though the book is not moving, it has stored energy due to its **position above the ground**.\n\nIf the book falls, this stored GPE will transform into **kinetic energy** as it moves. The fact that energy can be released when the book falls proves the energy was there all along.\n\n**Energy doesn't require movement** - objects can store energy through their position, chemical bonds, or other properties. Only **kinetic energy** requires motion; other forms like GPE, chemical, and elastic energy can exist in stationary objects.",

    "solution": "As the cricket ball slows down, its **kinetic energy decreases**. However, according to the **law of conservation of energy**, this energy is not destroyed - it is **transformed** into other forms.\n\n**Energy transformation:**\n\nThe ball's kinetic energy is transformed into:\n\n1. **Heat energy** - Created by **air resistance** (friction with air molecules). Both the ball and the surrounding air heat up slightly.\n\n2. **Sound energy** - You can hear the ball whooshing through the air as it displaces air molecules.\n\n**Why the ball slows:**\n\nThe ball experiences a **resistive force** from the air (drag/air resistance) opposing its motion. This force does **negative work** on the ball, transforming its kinetic energy into heat and sound.\n\n**Conservation principle:**\n\nThe **total amount of energy** remains constant:\n\n**Initial KE = Final KE + Heat Energy + Sound Energy**\n\nThe ball slows because its kinetic energy is continuously being **dissipated** (spread out) into the environment, but the total energy in the system is **conserved**.",

Use the law of conservation of energy in your explanation.",
    "solution": "The probe's kinetic energy remains constant because of the **law of conservation of energy** and **Newton's First Law** (inertia).\n\n**Key points:**\n\n1. **No forces acting**: In deep space with no air resistance and far from gravitational forces, there are **no forces** acting on the probe to slow it down or speed it up.\n\n2. **Conservation of energy**: According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since there are no forces doing work on the probe:\n   - No energy is being **added** to the system\n   - No energy is being **removed** from the system\n   - Therefore, the kinetic energy **stays constant**\n\n3. **No transformation**: For KE to decrease, it would need to transform into another form (like heat from friction). But with **no air resistance** and **no friction**, there is no mechanism to transform the kinetic energy into other forms.\n\n4. **Constant velocity**: Since $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and both mass (m) and velocity (v) remain constant, the kinetic energy must remain constant.\n\n**Why engines aren't needed:**\n\nOn Earth, vehicles need constant engine power because **friction** and **air resistance** continuously transform kinetic energy into heat. In space, with no friction, the probe **coasts** indefinitely at constant velocity - no energy input needed!\n\nThis is why space travel is actually very fuel-efficient once you're in space - engines are only needed to change speed or direction, not to maintain motion.",

The energy still exists (conservation of energy) but is **dispersed** and no longer useful for generating electricity.\n\n**Why hydroelectric is most efficient:**\nHydroelectric doesn't involve combustion (burning fuel), which always releases large amounts of waste heat. It directly converts mechanical energy (falling water) to electrical energy with fewer transformation steps, so less energy is lost along the way.",
