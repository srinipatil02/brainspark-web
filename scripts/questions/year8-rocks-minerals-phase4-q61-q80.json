Reduced pressure (decompression melting):**\n- At **divergent boundaries** (mid-ocean ridges), plates move apart\n- Mantle rock rises to fill the gap\n- As it rises, **pressure decreases** dramatically\n- Lower pressure allows hot mantle rock to **cross the melting point** and become liquid magma\n- This is the most common way magma forms\n\n**2. Addition of water (flux melting):**\n- At **subduction zones**, the descending oceanic plate carries water-rich minerals and sediments\n- Water **lowers the melting point** of mantle rock (like salt on ice)\n- Even though temperature hasn't increased much, the mantle rock **melts** to form magma\n- This creates the volcanic chains above subduction zones\n\n**3. Increased temperature (hot spots):**\n- At **mantle plumes** (hot spots), extra-hot rock from deep in the mantle rises\n- The additional heat can cause melting even in the middle of tectonic plates\n\n**Key point:** The mantle remains mostly solid, but **changes in pressure, water content, or temperature** at plate boundaries create the conditions for localized melting.",

Early life evidence (bonus):**\n- Some Pilbara rocks contain **stromatolites** - layered structures created by early bacteria\n- These provide evidence that **life existed** on Earth over 3.5 billion years ago\n\n**4. Early atmospheric composition:**\n- The **banded iron formations** in the Pilbara show that the early atmosphere had **very little oxygen**\n- Iron dissolved in ancient oceans could only precipitate when oxygen-producing bacteria appeared\n\n**Significance:** These ancient rocks are like **time capsules** - they survived billions of years of geological change and provide our only direct evidence of Earth's first billion years.

    "solution": "Tectonic plates can move because the solid mantle rock beneath them **flows very slowly** through a process called **convection**. Here's how it works:\n\n**The mechanism:**\n\n**1. Mantle convection:**\n- Earth's **internal heat** (from radioactive decay) creates temperature differences in the mantle\n- **Hot mantle rock** near the core becomes less dense and **slowly rises**\n- **Cooler mantle rock** near the surface is denser and **slowly sinks**\n- This creates **convection currents** - circular flowing patterns in the solid mantle\n\n**2. Plastic deformation:**\n- Even though the mantle is **solid**, it can **deform and flow** when subjected to heat and pressure over long time periods\n- This property is called **plasticity** - like how silly putty is solid but can slowly flow\n- The mantle flows at rates of **centimeters per year** (about as fast as your fingernails grow)\n\n**3. Driving plate motion:**\n- The flowing mantle **drags** the tectonic plates above it\n- Plates are carried along on top of the flowing mantle like objects on a very slow-moving conveyor belt\n- This movement causes plates to **collide, separate, or slide past** each other\n\n**Key insight:** \"Solid\" doesn't mean \"rigid\" or \"immovable.\" Under extreme heat and pressure over millions of years, solid rock can **flow like a very thick fluid**.

Regional metamorphism:**\n- As continents collide, rocks are **compressed and buried** to great depths\n- **Pressure increases** dramatically from overlying rock (up to 10-15 km deep)\n- **Temperature increases** from Earth's internal heat (200-700°C)\n- **Sedimentary and igneous rocks transform** into metamorphic rocks:\n  - Shale → slate → schist → gneiss (increasing metamorphic grade)\n  - Limestone → marble\n  - Sandstone → quartzite\n  - Granite → gneiss\n\n**2. Mountain building (orogeny):**\n- Rocks are **folded and uplifted** to form mountain ranges\n- **Neither plate subducts** (both are too buoyant) - instead they crumple upward\n- Creates the world's highest mountains (e.g., **Himalayas, Alps**)\n\n**3. Partial melting (sometimes):**\n- At extreme depths and temperatures, some rocks may **partially melt**\n- Forms **granitic magma** that can intrude into surrounding rocks\n- Creates **igneous intrusions** within the mountain belt\n\n**4. Later exposure:**\n- Over millions of years, **uplift and erosion** bring metamorphic rocks to the surface\n- **Weathering** breaks them down, creating sediments that form new sedimentary rocks\n\n**Why this happens:**\n- Continental crust is **less dense** than oceanic crust, so it doesn't subduct easily\n- The collision **compresses horizontally** and **thickens vertically**\n- The combination of **compression, burial, heat, and pressure** creates perfect conditions for metamorphism\n\n**Evidence:** The Himalayas contain **marine fossils** at high elevations - former ocean floor sediments that were metamorphosed and uplifted during collision!",

    "solution": "**Errors identified:**\n\n1. **\"Liquid mantle\"** - The mantle is mostly **solid rock**, not liquid\n2. **\"Liquid mantle flows up\"** - Solid mantle rock doesn't simply flow up; it must **melt** to become magma\n3.

At **divergent plate boundaries** (where plates move apart):\n\n1. Solid mantle rock **rises** to fill the gap created by separating plates\n2. As the rock rises, **pressure decreases** dramatically\n3. The decrease in pressure causes the hot solid rock to **cross its melting point** and become liquid magma (this is called **decompression melting**)\n4. The magma rises through cracks and erupts at mid-ocean ridges, forming new **oceanic crust**\n\nThe mantle remains mostly solid - only small amounts melt at specific locations like plate boundaries. The **outer core** is the liquid layer inside Earth, not the mantle.\"\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nUnderstanding that the mantle is solid is crucial because:\n- It explains why tectonic plates can move (riding on flowing solid mantle)\n- It shows that magma is the **exception**, not the normal state\n- It reveals that **special conditions** (reduced pressure, added water, extra heat) are required to melt rock\n- It helps explain why volcanoes occur at specific locations (plate boundaries, hot spots) rather than everywhere",

What do they tell us about Earth's atmosphere 2 billion years ago?",
    "solution": "**How banded iron formations formed:**\n\n**Step 1: Iron-rich oceans (before 2.4 billion years ago)**\n- Earth's early atmosphere had **almost no oxygen**\n- Iron dissolved easily in ocean water (as Fe²⁺) because there was no oxygen to oxidize it\n- Ancient oceans contained **huge amounts of dissolved iron**\n\n**Step 2: Photosynthetic bacteria evolved**\n- Around **2.7-2.4 billion years ago**, **cyanobacteria** (early photosynthetic organisms) evolved\n- They produced **oxygen** as a waste product\n- Initially, this oxygen dissolved in ocean water\n\n**Step 3: Iron precipitation**\n- Dissolved iron reacted with oxygen to form **iron oxide (rust)**: Fe²⁺ + O₂ → Fe₂O₃\n- Iron oxide is **insoluble** and settled to the ocean floor as **red/brown layers**\n- When oxygen production slowed, **silica layers** were deposited instead\n- This created the **alternating bands** of iron oxide and silica\n\n**Step 4: Accumulation over millions of years**\n- Cycles of oxygen production and iron precipitation continued for millions of years\n- Thick deposits accumulated on the ocean floor\n- Eventually compressed and transformed into **hard rock formations**\n\n**What BIFs tell us about Earth's early atmosphere:**\n\n1. **Atmosphere was oxygen-poor:**\n   - If oxygen was already present in the atmosphere, iron wouldn't have dissolved in the oceans in the first place\n   - BIFs formed when the **first oxygen appeared** in Earth's history\n\n2. **Great Oxygenation Event:**\n   - BIFs mark the transition from an **oxygen-free** to an **oxygen-rich** atmosphere\n   - After about 1.8 billion years ago, BIFs stopped forming because all dissolved iron was used up and oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere\n\n3. **Early life evidence:**\n   - BIFs are **indirect evidence** that photosynthetic life existed 2+ billion years ago\n   - The oxygen that formed the iron oxide could only come from living organisms\n\n**Modern significance:**\n- Pilbara BIFs contain **35% of Australia's iron ore exports**\n- Worth billions of dollars annually\n- Provide high-quality iron for steel production\n- Are a unique \"frozen moment\" in Earth's history that can never form again (ocean chemistry has changed permanently)",

    "stem": "Mineral resources like copper, iron, and gold are **non-renewable** - once mined, they cannot be replaced on human timescales.\n\nPropose THREE strategies society could use to make mineral resource use more sustainable. For each strategy, explain how it helps conserve resources.",
    "solution": "**Three strategies for sustainable mineral resource use:**\n\n**1. Recycling and circular economy**\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Recycle metals from old products instead of always mining new ore\n- Design products for **easy disassembly and material recovery**\n- Create a **circular economy** where materials are continuously reused\n\n**How it helps:**\n- **Reduces mining demand:** Recycling aluminum uses **95% less energy** than producing it from bauxite ore\n- **Conserves ore deposits:** Every ton of recycled steel saves **1.4 tons of iron ore**\n- **Reduces waste:** Keeps valuable materials out of landfills\n- **Examples:** \n  - Recycling e-waste to recover gold, silver, copper, rare earth elements\n  - Melting down old cars for steel\n  - Reprocessing aluminum cans (can be recycled infinitely)\n\n**2. Improved extraction efficiency and technology**\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Develop better technology to extract minerals from **lower-grade ores**\n- Use **more efficient processing** methods to recover more metal from each ton of ore\n- Mine **previously uneconomical deposits** as technology improves\n\n**How it helps:**\n- **Extends ore reserves:** If we can profitably mine ore with 0.5% copper instead of needing 1%, we double the available resource\n- **Reduces waste:** Better recovery means less material discarded as tailings\n- **Reduces environmental impact per unit:** More efficient processes use less energy and chemicals\n- **Examples:**\n  - In-situ leaching (dissolving minerals underground without traditional mining)\n  - Improved flotation techniques\n  - Bioleaching (using bacteria to extract metals)\n\n**3. Substitution and reduced consumption**\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **Substitute** scarce minerals with more abundant alternatives\n- **Reduce overall consumption** through:\n  - Product longevity (make things last longer)\n  - Dematerialization (use less material per product)\n  - Sharing economy (car-sharing instead of ownership)\n\n**How it helps:**\n- **Reduces demand:** If products last twice as long, we need half as many\n- **Spreads resource use:** Using abundant materials for common applications preserves rare materials for essential uses\n- **Examples:**\n  - Substituting copper wiring with fiber optic cables (glass) for telecommunications\n  - Using carbon fiber instead of aluminum in some applications\n  - LED lights (use less material, last longer than incandescent bulbs)\n  - Digital products replacing physical ones (e-books vs. printed books reduces paper and ink demand)\n\n**Additional strategies:**\n\n**4. Urban mining:**\n- Treat cities as \"ore deposits\" - extract metals from building demolition, old infrastructure, electronic waste\n\n**5. Exploration and discovery:**\n- Find new ore deposits to supplement existing reserves\n- Note: This doesn't make resources renewable, but extends how long they'll last\n\n**6. Policy and regulation:**\n- Governments can incentivize recycling, mandate product durability, tax virgin materials to encourage reuse\n\n**The big picture:**\n\nTrue sustainability requires **combining all strategies**:\n- Mine more efficiently\n- Recycle extensively\n- Design products to last\n- Substitute where possible\n- Accept that we may need to consume less\n\nMineral resources formed over **millions to billions of years** through geological processes. We're extracting them in **decades to centuries**. Sustainability means slowing consumption to match what can be recycled and what new technology can unlock from lower-grade sources.",

Great Oxygenation Event (2.7-2.4 billion years ago)**\n\n**What happened:**\n- Photosynthetic bacteria evolved and produced **oxygen** for the first time\n- Dissolved **iron in ancient oceans** reacted with oxygen and precipitated\n- Created massive **banded iron formations (BIFs)**\n\n**Mineral resources created:**\n- **Pilbara iron ore deposits** - among the world's largest and richest\n- **35% of Australia's export earnings** come from Pilbara iron ore\n- These formations can **never form again** because ocean chemistry has permanently changed\n- High-grade ore (60-65% iron) requires minimal processing\n\n**3. Tectonic activity and hydrothermal ore formation (1.9-1.5 billion years ago)**\n\n**What happened:**\n- Plate tectonic processes caused **mountain building** and **volcanic activity**\n- **Hot fluids** (hydrothermal systems) circulated through rocks\n- Magmatic and metamorphic processes concentrated metals\n\n**Mineral resources created:**\n- **Mount Isa deposits** (1.65 billion years old) - world's largest lead-zinc-silver deposit\n- **Broken Hill** - one of the world's largest silver-lead-zinc deposits\n- **Olympic Dam** (1.6 billion years) - copper-uranium-gold-silver\n- Hydrothermal fluids dissolved, transported, and concentrated metals in ore-grade deposits\n\n**4.

    "solution": "Rocks are excellent **historical records** because they preserve information through their **formation, composition, and structure**:\n\n**How rocks preserve information:**\n\n**1. Sedimentary rocks record environmental conditions**\n\n**Information preserved:**\n- **Climate:** \n  - **Coal** indicates warm, swampy forests\n  - **Sandstone with cross-bedding** indicates ancient deserts or rivers\n  - **Evaporites** (salt, gypsum) indicate arid, evaporating seas\n- **Sea level changes:**\n  - **Marine fossils** in rocks now on mountains show the area was once underwater\n  - **Sequences of rock layers** record advancing and retreating seas\n- **Ancient environments:**\n  - **Grain size** reveals water energy (coarse = high energy like rivers, fine = low energy like deep ocean)\n  - **Sedimentary structures** (ripple marks, mud cracks) show ancient shorelines or tidal flats\n\n**Why it lasts:**\n- Once **buried and lithified** (turned to stone), sediments are protected from weathering\n- Layers accumulate continuously, creating a **stratigraphic record** of time\n- **Principle of superposition:** Deeper layers are older (unless disturbed)\n\n**2. Fossils preserve evidence of past life**\n\n**Information preserved:**\n- **What organisms existed:** Fossils show extinct species and evolutionary changes\n- **When they lived:** **Index fossils** help date rock layers\n- **Ancient ecosystems:** Assemblages of fossils reveal food webs and habitats\n- **Evolution:** Fossil sequences show how life changed over time\n\n**Example:**\n- **Pilbara stromatolites** (3.5 billion years old) prove life existed in early Earth\n- **Marine fossils in the Himalayas** prove mountains were once ocean floor\n\n**Why it lasts:**\n- Hard parts (shells, bones) are **mineralized** - replaced by minerals that resist decay\n- **Rapid burial** prevents decomposition\n- Remains can survive billions of years if undisturbed\n\n**3. Chemical composition records atmospheric/ocean conditions**\n\n**Information preserved:**\n- **Oxygen isotopes** in minerals reveal ancient **temperatures**\n- **Carbon isotopes** indicate biological activity and atmospheric CO₂ levels\n- **Banded iron formations** show when **oxygen first appeared** in the atmosphere (2.4 billion years ago)\n- **Sulfur isotopes** reveal volcanic activity or microbial processes\n\n**Why it lasts:**\n- **Chemical signatures** are locked into crystal structures\n- **Isotope ratios** remain stable over billions of years\n- Different minerals form under specific temperature, pressure, and chemical conditions\n\n**4. Mineral assemblages record pressure and temperature**\n\n**Information preserved:**\n- **Metamorphic minerals** indicate depth of burial and temperature\n- **Igneous rock composition** reveals magma source (mantle vs. crust)\n- **Crystal size** shows cooling rate (large = slow cooling underground, small = fast cooling at surface)\n\n**Example:**\n- **Garnets** in metamorphic rocks indicate high pressure (deep burial)\n- **Zircon crystals** with water signatures prove early Earth had oceans\n\n**Why it lasts:**\n- Once formed, mineral assemblages are **stable** unless reheated or buried again\n- Even if the surrounding rock is later eroded, the **minerals preserve** their formation conditions\n\n**5. Structural features record tectonic events**\n\n**Information preserved:**\n- **Folds and faults** show ancient mountain-building events\n- **Foliation direction** in metamorphic rocks reveals stress direction\n- **Unconformities** (gaps in rock record) show periods of erosion or non-deposition\n- **Igneous intrusions** cutting through layers show relative timing of events\n\n**Example:**\n- **Folded sedimentary rocks** in mountain ranges prove tectonic compression\n- **Ancient fault lines** reveal past earthquake zones\n\n**Why it lasts:**\n- Deformation is **permanently recorded** in rock structure\n- Cross-cutting relationships preserve **sequence of events**\n\n**6. Radiometric dating provides absolute ages**\n\n**Information preserved:**\n- **Radioactive isotopes** decay at known rates\n- **Uranium-lead dating** of zircons gives precise ages (accurate to millions of years)\n- **Carbon-14 dating** works for young organic materials (up to ~50,000 years)\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Radioactive decay is **constant** and unaffected by external conditions\n- **\"Clock\" starts** when mineral crystallizes (for igneous/metamorphic) or organism dies (for carbon dating)\n\n**Why rocks are such good records:**\n\n1. **Durability:** Rocks survive billions of years if protected from erosion\n2. **Layering:** Sedimentary sequences create chronological records\n3. **Multiple lines of evidence:** Combine fossils, chemistry, minerals, and structure for complete story\n4. **Global distribution:** Rocks from different locations can be correlated\n5. **Resistance to change:** Once formed, rocks preserve their formation conditions unless reheated, buried, or eroded\n\n**The \"book\" analogy:**\n\nGeologists call sedimentary sequences \"pages in Earth's history book\":\n- Each **layer** is a page\n- **Fossils** are the illustrations\n- **Chemical composition** is the text\n- **Unconformities** are missing pages\n- **Igneous intrusions** are bookmarks showing when certain events occurred\n\nBy carefully \"reading\" rocks, geologists reconstruct **4.6 billion years** of Earth history - including formation of continents, evolution of life, climate changes, mass extinctions, and tectonic events!",

    "stem": "The **rock cycle** shows how igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks are connected through geological processes.\n\nTrace a complete journey through the rock cycle, starting with magma and ending back at magma. For each transformation, name:\n- The process involved\n- The energy source driving it\n- The approximate time scale",
    "solution": "**Complete rock cycle journey:**\n\n**Stage 1: MAGMA → IGNEOUS ROCK**\n\n**Process:** **Crystallization** (cooling and solidification)\n- Magma cools below its freezing point\n- Minerals crystallize in sequence (hottest minerals first)\n- Interlocking crystal structure forms\n\n**Energy source:** **Earth's internal heat** (being released as magma cools)\n\n**Time scale:**\n- **Extrusive (surface):** Days to years (basalt lava flows cool in days to months)\n- **Intrusive (underground):** Thousands to millions of years (large granite plutons cool over 100,000+ years)\n\n**Example:** Basalt lava flow hardens in days; granite batholith cools over 1 million years\n\n---\n\n**Stage 2: IGNEOUS ROCK → SEDIMENT**\n\n**Process:** **Weathering and erosion**\n- **Physical weathering:** Freeze-thaw, thermal expansion, root action break rock into fragments\n- **Chemical weathering:** Water, acids, oxygen dissolve or chemically alter minerals\n- **Erosion:** Wind, water, ice transport broken fragments away\n\n**Energy source:** **Sun's energy**\n- Powers water cycle (evaporation, precipitation)\n- Drives wind\n- Creates temperature fluctuations\n- Powers glacier formation\n\n**Time scale:** **Thousands to millions of years**\n- Hard rocks (granite) weather slowly (millions of years)\n- Soft rocks weather faster (thousands of years)\n- Depends on climate (wet = faster weathering)\n\n**Example:** Granite mountains erode at ~1 mm per 100 years; sandstone weathers 10× faster\n\n---\n\n**Stage 3: SEDIMENT → SEDIMENTARY ROCK**\n\n**Process:** **Deposition, compaction, and cementation** (lithification)\n- **Deposition:** Sediments settle when transport energy decreases (river slows, wind drops)\n- **Burial:** Additional layers accumulate on top\n- **Compaction:** Weight squeezes out water, reduces pore space\n- **Cementation:** Minerals (calcite, quartz, iron oxide) precipitate from groundwater and glue grains together\n\n**Energy source:** **Sun's energy** (for transport) + **gravity** (for settling and compaction)\n\n**Time scale:** **Thousands to millions of years**\n- **Deposition:** Can be rapid (flood deposits in hours) or slow (deep ocean sediments accumulate at mm/1000 years)\n- **Lithification:** Typically 1-10 million years for complete hardening\n\n**Example:** Sandstone forms from beach sand buried and cemented over 5 million years\n\n---\n\n**Stage 4: SEDIMENTARY ROCK → METAMORPHIC ROCK**\n\n**Process:** **Metamorphism** (transformation by heat and/or pressure)\n- **Burial:** Tectonic forces push rock deep underground (10-30 km depth)\n- **Heating:** Temperature increases with depth (~25°C per km)\n- **Pressure:** Overlying rock creates immense pressure\n- **Recrystallization:** Minerals change to new forms stable at higher temperature/pressure (without melting)\n\n**Energy source:** **Earth's internal heat** + **tectonic forces** (powered by internal heat)\n\n**Time scale:** **Millions of years**\n- Burial by tectonic processes: 10-50 million years\n- Recrystallization: 5-20 million years\n- Total metamorphism: typically 20-100 million years\n\n**Example:** Shale buried during mountain building transforms to slate over 30 million years\n\n---\n\n**Stage 5: METAMORPHIC ROCK → MAGMA**\n\n**Process:** **Melting** (when temperature exceeds the rock's melting point)\n- Rock buried to extreme depth (30-100 km)\n- Temperature reaches **700-1200°C**\n- Pressure may decrease (allowing melting)\n- OR water is added (lowers melting point)\n- Rock crosses melting point and becomes liquid magma\n\n**Energy source:** **Earth's internal heat** (from radioactive decay + residual heat from Earth's formation)\n\n**Time scale:** **Tens to hundreds of millions of years**\n- Burial to melting depth: 50-200 million years\n- Melting process itself: relatively rapid (thousands to millions of years once conditions are met)\n\n**Example:** Continental crust subducted and partially melted over 100 million years\n\n---\n\n**Alternative pathway: Direct melting**\n\nAny rock type can **skip stages** and melt directly:\n- **Igneous → Magma:** Remelting of existing igneous rock (subduction zone)\n- **Sedimentary → Magma:** Melting of sedimentary rock during deep burial (rare but possible)\n\n---\n\n**CYCLE COMPLETE! Back to Stage 1: Magma → Igneous Rock**\n\n---\n\n**Summary table:**\n\n| Transformation | Process | Energy Source | Time Scale |\n|----------------|---------|---------------|------------|\n| Magma → Igneous | Crystallization | Earth's internal heat | Days to millions of years |\n| Igneous → Sediment | Weathering/erosion | Sun's energy | Thousands to millions of years |\n| Sediment → Sedimentary | Lithification | Sun + gravity | Thousands to millions of years |\n| Sedimentary → Metamorphic | Metamorphism | Earth's internal heat | Millions of years |\n| Metamorphic → Magma | Melting | Earth's internal heat | Tens to hundreds of millions of years |\n\n---\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n1. **Two energy sources drive the cycle:**\n   - **Sun** → surface processes (weathering, erosion, deposition)\n   - **Earth's interior** → deep processes (metamorphism, melting, tectonic forces)\n\n2. **Time scales are enormous:**\n   - Complete cycle: **hundreds of millions to billions of years**\n   - Some rocks have cycled multiple times in Earth's 4.6-billion-year history\n\n3. **The cycle is continuous:**\n   - As long as Earth has internal heat and the Sun shines, the rock cycle continues\n   - When Earth's core cools completely (billions of years in the future), the cycle will slow dramatically\n\n4. **Shortcuts exist:**\n   - Igneous can become metamorphic (skip sedimentary stage)\n   - Sedimentary can melt directly (skip metamorphic stage)\n   - Metamorphic can weather directly (skip melting stage)\n   - Any rock can transform to any other type through the right processes\n\n5. **Recycling:** The rock cycle **recycles Earth's materials**. Atoms in your body might have been in dinosaur bones (sedimentary), then metamorphosed, then melted, then erupted in lava, then weathered into soil - and plants absorbed them!",
