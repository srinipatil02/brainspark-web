Different minerals, same colour**\n- Many minerals are white: quartz, calcite, feldspar, talc\n- Many minerals are black: obsidian, magnetite, biotite, hornblende\n- Colour alone can't distinguish between them\n\n**More reliable identification properties:**\n- **Streak** (powder colour is more consistent)\n- **Hardness** (Mohs scale)\n- **Crystal shape**\n- **Lustre** (metallic, glassy, etc.)\n- **Cleavage/fracture** (how it breaks)\n\n**Best practice:** Use MULTIPLE properties together, not just colour.",

    "stem": "Geologists often use the **streak test** even when they can clearly see a mineral's colour.\n\nExplain why geologists prefer to test streak rather than just looking at a mineral's surface colour.",
    "solution": "**Why streak is more reliable than surface colour:**\n\n**1. Streak colour is more CONSISTENT**\n- A mineral's streak is usually the same regardless of impurities\n- Surface colour can vary widely in the same mineral\n- Example: Hematite can be silver, black, red, or brown on the surface, but ALWAYS has a red-brown streak\n\n**2. Impurities affect surface colour more than streak**\n- Tiny amounts of impurities can dramatically change surface colour\n- When ground to powder, the true colour of the pure mineral shows through\n- Example: Pure quartz is colourless, but impurities make rose quartz (pink), amethyst (purple), citrine (yellow)\n- All types of quartz have a WHITE streak\n\n**3. Surface colour can be affected by:**\n- Weathering and oxidation\n- Tarnishing\n- Thin coatings\n- Lighting conditions\n- These don't affect the streak colour\n\n**4. Streak helps distinguish look-alikes**\n- Pyrite (\"fool's gold\") - gold surface, BLACK streak\n- Real gold - gold surface, GOLD streak\n- Without streak test, they look similar!\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Only works for minerals softer than the streak plate (~7)\n- Harder minerals (quartz, diamond) don't leave a mark\n\n**Conclusion:** Streak reveals the mineral's TRUE colour, unaffected by impurities or surface conditions.",
