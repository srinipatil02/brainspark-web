Aerobic respiration **requires oxygen**: Glucose + Oxygen → CO₂ + H₂O + Energy (ATP)\n4. **Mitochondria** in muscle cells perform this process\n5. More oxygen = more efficient ATP production\n\n**The body's response**:\n- **Breathing rate increases** → more oxygen inhaled\n- **Heart rate increases** → faster oxygen delivery to muscles\n- **Blood flow to muscles increases** → prioritize oxygen delivery\n- **Breathing depth increases** → more oxygen per breath\n\n**What happens if oxygen supply can't keep up**:\n- Cells switch to **anaerobic respiration** (without oxygen)\n- Produces **lactic acid** (causes muscle burning sensation)\n- Produces only **2 ATP per glucose** (much less efficient)\n- Can't be sustained for long - this is why you can sprint briefly but not for miles\n\n**The connection**:\n- You feel **out of breath** because your cells are demanding oxygen\n- You feel **tired** when ATP production can't keep up with demand\n- You **recover** by continuing to breathe heavily after exercise (repaying 'oxygen debt')\n\n**Why athletes train**: Training increases the **number and size of mitochondria** in muscle cells, improving oxygen use and ATP production efficiency.",

Vacuole **fills up** with water (like a balloon)\n3. **Contracts** (squeezes) to pump water out of the cell\n4. Water is expelled through the cell membrane to the outside\n5. Vacuole **reforms** and the cycle repeats\n6.

    "solution": "To understand how any cell survives, the scientist should prioritize studying organelles responsible for **essential life functions**:\n\n**Priority 1: CELL MEMBRANE** (Essential for survival)\n- **Why**: Defines the boundary of the cell\n- **Function**: Controls what enters and exits (selective permeability)\n- **Critical questions**: \n  - How does it maintain integrity in extreme conditions?\n  - What transport mechanisms does it use?\n  - How does it prevent harmful substances from entering?\n- **Importance**: Without a functional membrane, the cell would literally fall apart\n\n**Priority 2: RIBOSOMES** (Essential for survival)\n- **Why**: All cells need to make proteins\n- **Function**: Protein synthesis from genetic instructions\n- **Critical questions**:\n  - What proteins is this cell making to survive extreme conditions?\n  - Are the ribosomes modified to work in these conditions?\n  - What special enzymes or structural proteins does it produce?\n- **Importance**: Proteins are needed for structure, enzymes, transport, repair\n\n**Priority 3: GENETIC MATERIAL** (DNA/Nucleus or nucleoid)\n- **Why**: Contains all instructions for cell function\n- **Function**: Stores genetic information, controls cell activities\n- **Critical questions**:\n  - What unique genes does this cell have?\n  - How is DNA protected in extreme conditions?\n  - What proteins are encoded that enable survival?\n- **Importance**: DNA directs all cellular processes\n\n**Priority 4: ENERGY-PRODUCING ORGANELLES**\n- **Mitochondria** (if eukaryotic) or similar structures (if prokaryotic)\n- **Why**: All cells need ATP for active processes\n- **Function**: Cellular respiration to produce energy\n- **Critical questions**:\n  - How does it generate energy in extreme conditions?\n  - What fuel sources does it use?\n  - Are there modifications to enzymes for extreme temperatures/pH?\n- **Importance**: Energy (ATP) powers all active cellular processes\n\n**Additional investigation priorities**:\n\n5. **Cell wall** (if present): How does it provide protection?\n6. **Special storage organelles**: How does it store nutrients/energy?\n7. **DNA repair mechanisms**: How does it fix damage from extreme conditions?\n8. **Specialized proteins**: Heat shock proteins, antifreeze proteins, etc.\n\n**Why this approach makes sense**:\n\n**All cells must**:\n1. **Maintain boundaries** (membrane)\n2. **Make proteins** (ribosomes + genetic material)\n3. **Generate energy** (mitochondria or equivalent)\n4. **Control internal conditions** (all of the above)\n\n**For extreme environments, look for**:\n- **Modified enzymes** that work at extreme temperatures/pH\n- **Protective compounds** (like antifreeze or heat-shock proteins)\n- **Enhanced repair mechanisms** for DNA damage\n- **Unique transport systems** for the cell membrane\n- **Special storage organelles** for nutrients or energy\n\n**Real-world examples**:\n- **Thermophiles** (heat-loving bacteria): Have heat-stable enzymes and special membrane lipids\n- **Psychrophiles** (cold-loving organisms): Have antifreeze proteins and flexible membranes\n- **Halophiles** (salt-loving organisms): Have special ion pumps in membranes\n\n**Scientific method**:\n1. Study the **essential organelles** first (membrane, ribosomes, DNA, energy production)\n2. Compare to **normal cells** to identify unique features\n3. Test **hypotheses** about how modifications enable extreme survival\n4. Sequence the **genome** to identify unique genes\n5. Study the **proteins** produced to understand adaptations",
