    "solution": "**Why chemical reactions can't always be easily reversed:**\n\nEven though atoms are only rearranged (not destroyed), reversing a reaction is difficult because:\n\n**1. Energy barriers:**\n- Chemical reactions involve energy changes\n- Most reactions release energy (exothermic) as they happen\n- To reverse them, you'd need to put that energy BACK IN\n- Example: Burning wood releases heat; to reverse it, you'd need to force CO₂ and H₂O back together with huge amounts of energy\n\n**2. Entropy (disorder):**\n- Many reactions increase disorder (products spread out)\n- Gases escape into the atmosphere and disperse\n- Gathering all the products back together is practically impossible\n- Example: The CO₂ from a burnt match disperses into the entire room\n\n**3. New chemical bonds:**\n- When atoms rearrange, they form new, often more stable bonds\n- Breaking these stable bonds requires significant energy input\n- Example: Proteins in a cooked egg form new cross-links that are very stable\n\n**Some reactions CAN be reversed** with enough energy:\n- Electrolysis can split water back into hydrogen and oxygen\n- But this requires electricity - you must input energy that was released",

How different metals produce different colours:**\n\nWhen metal compounds are heated to high temperatures:\n\n1. The heat energy is absorbed by **electrons** in the metal atoms\n2. Electrons **jump to higher energy levels** (become \"excited\")\n3. When they fall back down, they **release energy as light**\n4.

Why it's air pollution:**\n\nCar exhaust contributes to air pollution because:\n\n- **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change\n- Cars also produce **carbon monoxide (CO)** when combustion is incomplete - this is toxic to humans\n- **Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)** form from nitrogen in the air reacting at high engine temperatures - these cause smog and acid rain\n- **Particulate matter** (tiny particles) can damage lungs when breathed in\n\n**Word equation with sources:**\n$$\\underbrace{\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_{18}}_{\\text{from petrol}} + \\underbrace{\\text{12.5 O}_2}_{\\text{from air}} \\rightarrow \\underbrace{\\text{8 CO}_2}_{\\text{C from petrol, O from air}} + \\text{9 H}_2\\text{O}$$",

What causes apple browning:**\n\nApple browning is caused by **oxidation** - a chemical reaction with oxygen:\n\n- When you cut an apple, you expose cells containing an enzyme called **polyphenol oxidase (PPO)**\n- This enzyme catalyzes a reaction between **phenol compounds** in the apple and **oxygen** from the air\n- The products are brown-coloured compounds called **melanins**\n\n**Word equation:**\n$$\\text{phenols (in apple)} + \\text{oxygen (from air)} \\xrightarrow{enzyme} \\text{melanins (brown colour)}$$\n\n**2. How lemon juice prevents browning:**\n\nLemon juice prevents browning in **two ways**:\n\n1. **Barrier effect**: \n   - The lemon juice coats the apple surface\n   - This physically blocks oxygen from reaching the apple flesh\n   - No oxygen contact = no oxidation reaction\n\n2. **Acid effect**:\n   - Lemon juice is acidic (contains citric acid)\n   - The enzyme (PPO) that causes browning works best at neutral pH\n   - Acid **denatures** (deactivates) the enzyme, stopping it from working\n   - Even if oxygen reaches the apple, the reaction can't happen without the enzyme\n\n**Other methods to prevent browning:**\n- Submerging in water (blocks oxygen)\n- Heating/cooking (denatures the enzyme)\n- Adding salt water (blocks oxygen, affects enzyme)",

    "solution": "**Why digestion IS a chemical reaction:**\n\nDigestion is indeed a chemical reaction, not just \"cutting\" - here's why:\n\n**1. Bond breaking and forming:**\n- In digestion, **chemical bonds are broken** between atoms in food molecules\n- **New chemical bonds form** with water molecules (this is called hydrolysis)\n- The products have different chemical structures than the original food\n\n**Example - Breaking down starch:**\n$$\\text{starch} + \\text{water} \\xrightarrow{enzyme} \\text{maltose (sugars)}$$\n\n- Starch is a long chain of glucose molecules bonded together\n- Digestion doesn't just \"snap\" the chain - it adds water molecules at each break point\n- Each bond that breaks involves atoms rearranging: O-H from water joins one side, H joins the other\n\n**2. New substances form:**\n- The products (amino acids, simple sugars, fatty acids) have **different properties** than the original food\n- Proteins → amino acids (completely different behaviour)\n- Starch → glucose (sweet taste, different solubility)\n\n**3. Why it's not like physical cutting:**\n\n| Physical cutting | Chemical digestion |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| Breaks between molecules | Breaks within molecules (bonds) |\n| Same substance, smaller pieces | Different substances form |\n| No water involved | Water molecules incorporated |\n| Reversible | Irreversible |\n\n**Key insight:** When you cut bread with a knife, you separate molecules.
