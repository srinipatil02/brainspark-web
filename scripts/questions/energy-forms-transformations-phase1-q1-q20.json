    "solution": "A truck takes longer to stop than a small car (at the same speed) because the truck has **much more kinetic energy** to dissipate.\n\n**Explanation using energy concepts**:\n\n1. **Same speed, different mass**:\n   - Both vehicles traveling at the same speed\n   - Truck has much **greater mass** than a car\n   - Therefore, truck has **much more kinetic energy**\n\n2. **Energy must be removed**:\n   - To stop, all kinetic energy must be **transformed** into other forms (mainly thermal energy in the brakes)\n   - Truck has more kinetic energy = more energy to remove\n   - More energy to remove = **more time needed** to stop\n\n3. **Safety implications**:\n   - Trucks need **longer stopping distances**\n   - This is why speed limits for heavy vehicles are often lower\n   - Drivers must maintain greater following distances\n\n**Key principle**: The kinetic energy of a moving object depends on both its **mass** and **speed**. Since kinetic energy increases with mass, heavier vehicles (like trucks) have more energy that must be dissipated when stopping, requiring:\n- More powerful brakes\n- Longer braking distance\n- More time to come to a complete stop\n\nThis is a practical application of understanding kinetic energy in road safety!",

    "solution": "The correct answer is **B: They can transform into each other, but the total energy remains constant**.\n\nThis question tests your understanding of the **fundamental relationship** between kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.\n\n**Key principles**:\n\n**1. Energy Transformation**\n- These two forms of energy can **transform** into each other\n- Examples we've studied:\n  - Falling ball: GPE → Kinetic energy\n  - Ball thrown upward: Kinetic energy → GPE  \n  - Pendulum: GPE ⇄ Kinetic energy (back and forth)\n  - Roller coaster: GPE ⇄ Kinetic energy throughout the ride\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy**\n- While energy transforms between forms, the **total amount stays the same**\n- This is the **Law of Conservation of Energy**\n- Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed\n\n**3. Simultaneous Existence**\n- Objects can have **both types** of energy at the same time\n- Example: A bird flying has kinetic energy (motion) AND gravitational potential energy (height)\n\n**Mathematical relationship**:\nTotal Energy = Kinetic Energy + Gravitational Potential Energy = Constant\n\nAs one increases, the other decreases by the same amount (in ideal conditions).\n\n**Why other options are wrong**:\n- **A**: They ARE related - they transform into each other\n- **C**: The amounts vary depending on position and speed\n- **D**: Objects commonly have both simultaneously\n\n**Real-world significance**:\nThis relationship is fundamental to understanding:\n- How roller coasters work\n- Why dams can generate electricity (GPE → kinetic → electrical)\n- Sports like skateboarding, diving, and skiing\n- Safety considerations (falling objects, vehicle braking)\n\nUnderstanding this relationship is the **foundation** for all further energy studies in physics!",
