    "solution": "This statement is **completely incorrect**. Earth's surface is **constantly changing**, but most changes happen so slowly that humans don't notice them within a lifetime.\n\n**Evidence Earth's surface changes:**\n\n**1. The Rock Cycle:**\n- Rocks continuously transform: igneous → sedimentary → metamorphic\n- **Mountains** are uplifted through tectonic forces, then **eroded** over millions of years\n- **Weathering** breaks down rocks at the surface\n- **Sediment** is deposited in new locations, forming new rock layers\n\n**2. Geological Timescales:**\n- **Mountain formation**: Millions of years\n- **Erosion**: Can wear down entire mountain ranges over millions of years\n- **Volcanic activity**: Builds new land (hours to centuries)\n- **Tectonic movement**: Continents drift 2-10 cm per year\n\n**3. Australian Examples:**\n- **Great Dividing Range**: Formed 300 million years ago, has been heavily eroded since\n- **Lord Howe Island**: 7-million-year-old volcano, now mostly eroded\n- **Uluru**: Ancient rock formation, continuously weathering\n\n**Why it seems unchanging:**\n- Human lifespan (~80 years) is **infinitesimally short** compared to geological timescales (millions of years)\n- We see only a **snapshot** of ongoing change\n\n**Key concept**: Earth's surface is **dynamic** but changes on **geological timescales** far beyond human perception.

Tectonic plate movement is extremely slow:**\n- Plates move at **2-10 cm per year** (about the rate fingernails grow)\n- To build mountains thousands of meters high requires **millions of years** of continuous movement and compression\n- **Why so slow?** Moving massive continental plates through the mantle requires enormous forces and occurs through slow convection currents in Earth's interior\n\n**2. Sediment accumulation is gradual:**\n- Sediment typically accumulates at **millimeters to centimeters per year**\n- To build sedimentary rock layers **kilometers thick** requires millions of years\n- **Why so slow?** Weathering, erosion, and deposition are limited by rates of chemical reactions, water flow, and sediment transport\n\n**3. Burial and compaction take time:**\n- Sediment must be **buried deeply** (often kilometers) to experience enough pressure for cementation\n- Burial requires continuous deposition over vast timescales\n\n**4. Heat transfer through rock is slow:**\n- Rock is a **poor conductor of heat**\n- Large underground magma bodies (like granite plutons) cool **extremely slowly**—heat escapes at rates of degrees per thousand years\n\n**5. Chemical reactions in solid rock are slow:**\n- Metamorphic recrystallization happens in **solid state**—atoms must rearrange without the rock melting\n- Solid-state diffusion is inherently slow\n\n**Contrast with fast processes:**\n- **Volcanic eruptions** are fast because they involve **liquid magma** exposed to cool air/water\n- **Earthquakes** are fast because they release **stored elastic energy** suddenly\n\n**Key concept**: Geological processes involving **gradual accumulation** (sediment, tectonic movement) or **slow physical processes** (heat conduction, solid-state reactions) operate on geological timescales far beyond human experience.",
