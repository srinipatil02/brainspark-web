Speed depends on kinetic energy**:\n- KE = ½ × m × v²\n- More kinetic energy = higher velocity (v)\n- To reach 90 km/h requires a specific amount of kinetic energy\n- This requires a corresponding amount of initial GPE\n\n**Why a taller hill works:**\n\n**Energy perspective:**\n- **Taller hill** → More GPE at top\n- More GPE → More energy available for transformation\n- More energy → Higher kinetic energy at bottom\n- Higher KE → **Faster speed** (could reach 90 km/h)\n\n**Shorter hill problem:**\n- **Shorter hill** → Less GPE at top\n- Less initial energy means less final kinetic energy\n- Result: Lower maximum speed (might only reach 60 km/h)\n\n**Real-world considerations:**\n- Some energy **lost to friction** (heat) and air resistance\n- Designer must make hill **even taller** than ideal to account for losses\n- This is why the first hill is usually the **tallest** on a roller coaster\n\n**Key principle:** To achieve a target speed, you need sufficient **gravitational potential energy** at the start.

      "solution": "This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nThe book does have energy - specifically **gravitational potential energy (GPE)**. Even though the book is not moving, it has stored energy due to its **position above the ground**.\n\nIf the book falls, this stored GPE will transform into **kinetic energy** as it moves. The fact that energy can be released when the book falls proves the energy was there all along.\n\n**Energy doesn't require movement** - objects can store energy through their position, chemical bonds, or other properties. Only **kinetic energy** requires motion; other forms like GPE, chemical, and elastic energy can exist in stationary objects.",

      "solution": "**Complete Energy Pathway:**\n\n**1. Petrol in tank:**\n- Chemical potential energy stored in hydrocarbon bonds\n- This is concentrated, high-quality energy\n\n**2. Combustion in engine:**\n- Chemical PE → Thermal energy (hot gases)\n- Gases expand, pushing pistons\n- Thermal → Kinetic energy (mechanical motion)\n\n**3. Transmission:**\n- Engine KE → Wheel KE via gears\n- Some → thermal (friction in gearbox)\n\n**4. Driving:**\n- Wheel KE → Car motion\n- Continuously lost to:\n  - Air resistance (heats the air)\n  - Tyre friction (heats road and tyres)\n  - Engine waste heat (radiator)\n\n**5. Final fate:**\n- ALL original chemical energy becomes dispersed thermal energy\n- Slightly warmer air along your route\n- Spread among billions of air molecules\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNo energy disappeared. It transformed: concentrated chemical PE → dispersed thermal energy in the environment. The energy exists but is now too spread out to be useful - this is energy degradation, not destruction.",

A perpetual motion machine would need to create energy from nothing to overcome losses - this violates conservation.\n\n**Concept 2: Energy Degradation**\nWith every transformation, some useful energy becomes thermal energy:\n- Friction in moving parts → heat\n- Air resistance → heat\n- Sound from vibrations → dispersed energy\n\nThis energy spreads out and becomes unusable. Even if total energy is conserved, usable energy continuously decreases.\n\n**Concept 3: Efficiency < 100%**\nNo real machine can be 100% efficient. Every energy transformation loses some energy to thermal output:\n- Bearings have friction\n- Electrical components have resistance\n- Moving parts create air resistance\n\n**Concept 4: Second Law of Thermodynamics**\nEnergy naturally flows from concentrated to dispersed. To maintain motion, a machine would need to reverse this - concentrating dispersed energy - which doesn't happen spontaneously.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nA perpetual motion machine would need to either:\n1. Create energy (violates conservation)\n2. Operate at 100% efficiency (impossible)\n3. Reverse energy degradation (violates thermodynamics)\n\nAll three are impossible, so perpetual motion machines cannot exist.",
