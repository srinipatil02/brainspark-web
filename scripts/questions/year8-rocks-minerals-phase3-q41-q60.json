The fragments wash into a river, get deposited in a delta, and after millions of years of burial and cementation, form **sandstone** (sedimentary).\n\nThe rock never experienced the high heat and pressure needed to become metamorphic - it went straight from igneous to sedimentary through **surface processes**.",

What happens to the coral after it dies?",
    "solution": "Corals create limestone through a **biological and geological process**:\n\n**How corals make limestone:**\n\n1. **Living corals extract minerals** - Coral polyps (tiny living animals) extract **calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)** from seawater\n\n2. **Build skeletons** - They use this calcium carbonate to build hard **exoskeletons** for protection\n\n3. **Death and accumulation** - When corals die, their soft bodies decompose but their **hard calcium carbonate skeletons remain**\n\n4. **Layering** - Dead coral skeletons accumulate in layers on the ocean floor, mixed with shells from other marine organisms\n\n5. **Compaction and cementation** - Over millions of years, the weight of upper layers **compresses** the lower layers. Minerals dissolved in seawater **crystallize between the fragments**, cementing them together\n\n6. **Limestone formation** - This process creates **limestone**, a sedimentary rock made primarily of calcium carbonate\n\n**Key insight:** The Great Barrier Reef is both a **living ecosystem** (the coral polyps on top) and an **ancient rock formation** (the limestone underneath). The reef has been building for millions of years, with each generation of coral adding to the limestone base.\n\nThis shows how **biological processes** (coral building skeletons) and **geological processes** (compaction and cementation) work together to form sedimentary rocks.",

Energy source and rate:**\n\n**Fast processes** (hours to days):\n- Have **concentrated, rapid energy release**\n- Example: Volcanic eruption - huge amount of thermal energy released quickly as magma reaches surface\n- Example: Earthquake - stored tectonic energy released suddenly\n\n**Slow processes** (millions of years):\n- Energy is **dispersed or applied gradually**\n- Example: Tectonic plate movement - continuous but very slow (2-10 cm/year)\n- Example: Chemical weathering - reactions happen slowly at surface temperatures\n\n**2. Temperature and cooling rate:**\n\n- **High temperature differences** → Faster processes\n  - Lava at 1200°C contacting 20°C air cools rapidly (hours)\n- **Small temperature differences** → Slower processes\n  - Underground magma insulated by warm rock cools over thousands of years\n\n**3. Physical constraints:**\n\n- **Deformation of solid rock** is inherently slow\n  - Rocks are strong and resist bending/breaking\n  - Mountain building requires sustained force over millions of years\n- **Flowing liquids** can move quickly\n  - Lava can flow rapidly during eruptions\n\n**4. Scale of the process:**\n\n- **Small-scale:** Water freezing in rock cracks (hours to days)\n- **Large-scale:** Continental drift moving continents thousands of kilometers (millions of years)\n\n**Key insight:**\n\nGeological processes operate on timescales determined by their **energy sources, temperatures, material properties, and spatial scales**. Processes involving:\n- Rapid energy release, high temperatures, or fluid flow → Fast (hours to years)\n- Gradual energy application, solid rock deformation, or continental scales → Slow (millions of years)\n\nThis is why we can watch volcanic eruptions but can't see continents drifting - the physics governing each process operates at vastly different rates.",

    "stem": "Imagine you could follow a **single grain of quartz sand** through the rock cycle for 500 million years.\n\nDescribe a possible journey this grain might take, including:\n- At least **3 different rock types** it becomes part of\n- The **geological processes** that transform it at each stage\n- Approximate **timescales** for each transformation\n\nBe creative but scientifically accurate!",
    "solution": "**The 500-million-year journey of a quartz grain:**\n\n**Stage 1: Sandstone (Sedimentary) - Starting point**\n- Our quartz grain is part of **sandstone** on an ancient beach (500 million years ago)\n- The sandstone formed from compressed and cemented sand over **~10 million years**\n\n**Stage 2: Buried and Metamorphosed (→ Quartzite)**\n*Process: Plate tectonics & mountain building (50 million years)*\n- Continental collision buries the sandstone **20 km deep**\n- **Heat (300°C) and pressure** cause the quartz grains to **recrystallize** and fuse together\n- The sandstone transforms into **quartzite** (metamorphic rock)\n- Our quartz grain remains quartz but is now **interlocked** with other quartz grains\n- Timeline: Occurs over **~50 million years** of burial and mountain building\n\n**Stage 3: Exposed and Weathered (→ Back to Sand)**\n*Process: Uplift & erosion (100 million years)*\n- The mountain range is **uplifted** by continued tectonic forces\n- **Erosion** gradually removes overlying rock over **100 million years**\n- The quartzite is exposed at the surface\n- **Weathering** breaks down the quartzite along crystal boundaries\n- Our quartz grain is **freed** as individual sand grain again (quartz is very resistant to weathering)\n\n**Stage 4: Deposited as Sediment**\n*Process: Transport & deposition (1 million years)*\n- River carries the grain to ocean (**~100,000 years**)\n- Settles on continental shelf with other sediment\n- Buried under accumulating layers\n\n**Stage 5: New Sandstone Formation**\n*Process: Compaction & cementation (20 million years)*\n- Burial under **2 km of sediment**\n- Pressure compacts layers\n- Minerals precipitate from groundwater, **cementing** grains together\n- Our quartz grain is now part of **new sandstone** (sedimentary)\n- Takes **~20 million years**\n\n**Stage 6: Deep Burial and Melting (→ Granite)**\n*Process: Subduction & melting (remaining ~319 million years)*\n- Subduction zone carries the sandstone **deep into mantle**\n- Temperature exceeds **1500°C** - the quartz **melts** into magma\n- Our quartz grain's atoms are now part of **molten silica**\n- Magma rises and cools slowly underground over **1-2 million years**\n- Crystallizes as **granite** (intrusive igneous rock)\n- Our original quartz atoms form **new quartz crystals** in the granite\n\n**Summary:**\nQuartz sand → Sandstone → Quartzite → Sand → Sandstone → Magma → Granite\n\n**Key insights:**\n- The quartz atoms persist through multiple rock types\n- Some transformations (weathering → sand) preserve the mineral; others (melting) break it down and reform it\n- Timescales vary from millions to hundreds of millions of years\n- The rock cycle has **no set pathway** - many routes are possible!",
