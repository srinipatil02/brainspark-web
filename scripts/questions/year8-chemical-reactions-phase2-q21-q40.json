    "stem": "A camping gas stove uses butane fuel. When burning:\n\n**butane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water vapour + energy**\n\nExplain why:\n1. The gas canister gets lighter as you use the stove\n2. You need ventilation when using the stove inside a tent\n\nUse the word equation in your answer.",
    "solution": "**1. Why the gas canister gets lighter:**\n\nThe **reactants** (butane and oxygen) are being **used up** and converted into **products** (carbon dioxide and water vapour).\n\n- **Butane** from the canister is being consumed in the combustion reaction\n- The products are **gases** that escape into the air\n- Mass is not lost (Law of Conservation of Mass), but the gases **leave the canister** and disperse\n- Result: Canister contains less butane → lighter weight\n\n**2. Why you need ventilation:**\n\n**Problem 1: Oxygen depletion**\n- The reaction **uses oxygen** from the air\n- In a closed tent, oxygen levels drop\n- You need oxygen to breathe!\n\n**Problem 2: Carbon dioxide buildup**\n- The reaction **produces carbon dioxide**\n- CO₂ accumulates in closed spaces\n- High CO₂ levels are toxic (causes dizziness, unconsciousness)\n\n**Ventilation solution:**\n- Fresh air brings in **oxygen** (reactant needed)\n- Exhaust gases (CO₂, water vapour) **escape**\n- Maintains safe, breathable air\n\n**Safety principle**: Combustion reactions always need ventilation because they:\n1. Consume oxygen (which you need to breathe)\n2. Produce carbon dioxide (which is harmful in high concentrations)\n\nThis is the same reason you need ventilation for car engines, heaters, and any combustion device!",
