    "solution": "The substance is a **compound**.\n\n**Evidence 1 - Fixed melting point:** The sharp melting point of 801°C indicates a **pure substance** (not a mixture, which would melt over a range of temperatures).\n\n**Evidence 2 - Produces two elements:** When electrolysed, it **breaks down into two different elements**, proving it contains **chemically bonded atoms** of different types. This is characteristic of compounds. (Note: This is actually table salt, NaCl, which produces sodium and chlorine.)\n\n**Evidence 3 - Identical composition:** All samples having the **same composition** confirms it's a pure substance with a **fixed ratio** of elements, not a variable mixture.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only compounds have all these properties - they're pure substances made of chemically bonded different elements that can be broken down by chemical means (like electrolysis).",

Justify your answer using:\n1. The definition of compounds vs. mixtures\n2. Evidence about bronze's properties\n3. How bronze is formed and can be separated",
    "solution": "**Student B is correct** - bronze is a **mixture** (specifically, a solid solution called an alloy), not a compound.\n\n**Evidence and reasoning:**\n\n**1. Definition comparison:**\n\n**Compounds:**\n- Elements chemically bonded in fixed ratios\n- Completely new properties\n- Require chemical reactions to separate\n- Fixed composition (e.g., H₂O is always 2:1)\n\n**Mixtures:**\n- Substances physically mixed together\n- Retain individual properties (somewhat)\n- Can be separated by physical means\n- Variable composition\n\n**2. Evidence about bronze:**\n\n- **Variable composition:** Bronze can be made with different ratios of copper to tin (typically 88% Cu, 12% Sn, but this varies). Compounds always have fixed ratios.\n\n- **Properties intermediate:** Bronze's properties (hardness, melting point, color) are **between** those of copper and tin - it's harder than copper but softer than many copper compounds would be. It retains some metallic properties of both metals.\n\n- **No chemical formula:** Bronze doesn't have a fixed chemical formula like CuSn or Cu₃Sn₂ - the ratio varies depending on the desired properties.\n\n**3. Formation and separation:**\n\n- **Formation:** Bronze is made by **melting and mixing** metals together - a **physical process**. The copper and tin atoms are **intermingled** but not chemically bonded.\n\n- **Separation:** While difficult, bronze could theoretically be separated using **physical methods** like:\n  - Fractional crystallization (different melting points)\n  - Electrochemical separation\n  - These are physical processes, not chemical decomposition\n\n- **Atomic structure:** In bronze, copper and tin atoms are **randomly distributed** in a metallic lattice, sharing electrons in metallic bonding (not forming specific Cu-Sn chemical bonds).\n\n**Conclusion:** Bronze is a **homogeneous mixture** (alloy) where copper and tin atoms are uniformly mixed at the atomic level through metallic bonding, but not chemically bonded in fixed ratios like a compound would be.",

    "stem": "In 1789, chemist Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated that when mercury (Hg) is heated in air, it forms a red powder (mercury oxide, HgO). He carefully measured:\n\n**Before heating:**\n- Mercury: 100.0 g\n- Oxygen (in sealed container): 8.0 g\n- Total: 108.0 g\n\n**After heating:**\n- Red mercury oxide powder: 108.0 g\n\nLavoisier used this to support his Law of Conservation of Mass. Explain:\n1. Why the mass stayed the same\n2. What type of substance was formed\n3. How this disproved the earlier \"phlogiston theory\" that mass decreased during heating",
    "solution": "**1. Why mass stayed the same:**\n\nThe total mass remained **108.0 g** because of the **Law of Conservation of Mass**: matter is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions - atoms are only **rearranged**.\n\n**What happened at the atomic level:**\n- Mercury atoms (100.0 g) + Oxygen atoms (8.0 g) = 108.0 g of atoms total\n- During heating, these atoms **chemically bonded** to form mercury oxide\n- **Same atoms, new arrangement**: No atoms were lost or gained\n- Chemical equation: $$2\\text{Hg} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{HgO}$$\n- All the original Hg and O atoms are still present in the product (HgO)\n\n**2. Type of substance formed:**\n\nMercury oxide (HgO) is a **compound** because:\n- It contains **two different elements** (Hg and O) **chemically bonded** together\n- It has **completely different properties** than mercury metal:\n  - Mercury: silvery liquid metal\n  - Mercury oxide: red solid powder\n- It has a **fixed composition**: always 1 Hg : 1 O ratio\n- Requires **chemical decomposition** to separate (heating alone in absence of oxygen, or electrolysis)\n\n**3. How this disproved phlogiston theory:**\n\n**Old phlogiston theory claimed:**\n- When substances burn or are heated in air, they release an invisible substance called \"phlogiston\"\n- This would cause **mass to decrease**\n- Ashes/powders weigh less because phlogiston escaped\n\n**Lavoisier's evidence disproved this:**\n- By using a **sealed container** and **precise measurement**, he showed mass **stayed constant**\n- The mass didn't decrease - instead, oxygen from the air was **added** to the mercury\n- When people previously observed \"mass decrease,\" they weren't accounting for gases released or absorbed\n- **Nothing was lost** - atoms just rearranged through chemical bonding\n\n**Historical significance:**\nThis experiment was revolutionary because it:\n- Established the Law of Conservation of Mass\n- Proved chemical reactions involve **rearrangement** of atoms, not creation/destruction\n- Showed the importance of **precise measurement** and **closed systems**\n- Helped establish modern chemistry by replacing incorrect phlogiston theory\n- Demonstrated that apparent mass changes involve gases being added or released",

    "stem": "A student performs an experiment with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂):\n\n**Observation 1:** Pure hydrogen peroxide is a clear liquid that looks identical to water\n**Observation 2:** When a catalyst (manganese dioxide) is added, it rapidly decomposes into water (H₂O) and oxygen gas (O₂)\n**Observation 3:** The process can be represented as:\n$$2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{O}_2$$\n\nUsing this evidence, explain:\n1. Why hydrogen peroxide is classified as a compound, not an element\n2. Why you cannot use appearance alone to identify substances\n3. What type of change occurs during decomposition",
    "solution": "**1. Why H₂O₂ is a compound, not an element:**\n\nHydrogen peroxide is a **compound** because:\n\n**a) Composition:**\n- Contains **two different elements**: hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O)\n- Elements contain only **one type of atom**\n- The subscripts show **2 H atoms and 2 O atoms** bonded together\n\n**b) Can be decomposed:**\n- Breaks down into **simpler substances** (H₂O and O₂)\n- **Elements cannot be broken down** into simpler substances by chemical means\n- The decomposition proves the hydrogen and oxygen were **chemically bonded**\n\n**c) Fixed composition:**\n- Always has the ratio H:O = 2:2 = 1:1\n- Chemical formula H₂O₂ never varies\n- This fixed ratio is characteristic of compounds\n\n**d) Chemical bonding:**\n- H and O atoms are **covalently bonded** in H-O-O-H structure\n- These bonds must be **broken chemically** (using catalyst)\n- Cannot be separated by physical means\n\n**2. Why appearance cannot identify substances:**\n\nAppearance is **NOT a reliable identifier** because:\n\n**a) Different substances can look identical:**\n- Both H₂O₂ and H₂O are clear, colorless liquids\n- Yet they are **completely different compounds** with different:\n  - Chemical formulas (H₂O₂ vs H₂O)\n  - Properties (H₂O₂ is reactive, bleaches, bubbles with catalyst; H₂O is stable)\n  - Uses (H₂O₂ is antiseptic; H₂O is drinking water)\n\n**b) Many clear liquids exist:**\n- Water, hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, vinegar, etc.\n- All look similar but have different compositions and properties\n\n**c) Need chemical tests:**\n- Must use **chemical properties** or **composition analysis** to identify substances\n- Examples: reaction tests, spectroscopy, chromatography, measuring properties like boiling point\n\n**3. Type of change during decomposition:**\n\nThis is a **CHEMICAL CHANGE** (chemical reaction) because:\n\n**Evidence:**\n\n**a) New substances formed:**\n- Started with: hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)\n- Ended with: water (H₂O) + oxygen gas (O₂)\n- **Completely different substances** with different properties\n\n**b) Chemical bonds broken and formed:**\n- **Broken:** O-O bond in H-O-O-H\n- **Formed:** New H-O bonds in separate H₂O molecules and O=O bonds in O₂ molecules\n- Atoms **rearranged** into new configurations\n\n**c) Energy change:**\n- Reaction releases **energy** (exothermic)\n- May produce heat and bubbles\n- Energy changes indicate chemical reactions\n\n**d) Difficult to reverse:**\n- Cannot easily convert H₂O and O₂ back to H₂O₂\n- Would require different chemical reaction with energy input\n- Physical changes are easily reversible\n\n**e) Follows chemical equation:**\n- **Atoms conserved:** 4 H atoms and 4 O atoms on both sides\n- Law of conservation of mass applies\n- Atoms rearranged but not created/destroyed\n\n**Summary:**\nHydrogen peroxide demonstrates key chemical principles: (1) compounds contain bonded elements in fixed ratios, (2) appearance alone cannot identify substances - chemical analysis is needed, and (3) decomposition is a chemical change that breaks bonds and creates new substances.",

    "stem": "Two ancient civilizations discovered how to make bronze (copper + tin alloy) around 3300 BCE, while pure copper was used since 9000 BCE. Bronze became the preferred material for tools and weapons despite being more difficult to produce.\n\nUsing your knowledge of elements, compounds, and mixtures, explain:\n\n1. Why bronze (a mixture) has different properties than pure copper (an element)\n2. What specific property advantages made bronze preferable for tools and weapons\n3. Why metallurgists can adjust bronze properties by changing the copper-to-tin ratio, but cannot do this with pure copper",
    "solution": "**1. Why bronze has different properties than pure copper:**\n\nBronze is a **homogeneous mixture (alloy)** that has different properties than pure copper (an **element**) because:\n\n**a) Atomic structure differences:**\n- **Pure copper:** Contains only copper atoms arranged in a regular metallic lattice\n- **Bronze:** Contains both copper atoms AND tin atoms mixed throughout the metallic lattice\n- The **presence of tin atoms** disrupts the regular arrangement of copper atoms\n\n**b) Effect on properties:**\n- In pure copper, atoms can **slide past each other** relatively easily, making it soft and malleable\n- In bronze, tin atoms are **different sizes** than copper atoms - they act like \"obstacles\" preventing copper atoms from sliding\n- This makes bronze **harder and stronger** than pure copper\n- The atoms still share electrons (metallic bonding), but the mixed structure changes mechanical properties\n\n**c) Still retains some metallic properties:**\n- Both are good conductors (metals)\n- Both can be melted and shaped\n- But bronze has enhanced strength and durability\n\n**2. Property advantages of bronze for tools and weapons:**\n\n**a) Hardness:**\n- Bronze is significantly **harder** than pure copper\n- Tools and weapons need to maintain **sharp edges** and resist deformation\n- Copper is too soft - bends and dulls easily\n\n**b) Strength:**\n- Bronze has greater **tensile strength** (resists breaking under tension)\n- Can withstand **impact forces** in combat or tool use\n- Copper would bend or break under similar stress\n\n**c) Durability:**\n- Bronze is more **resistant to corrosion** than pure copper\n- Maintains sharpness longer\n- Tools last longer before needing replacement\n\n**d) Castability:**\n- Bronze flows better when molten, making detailed casting easier\n- Lower melting point than pure copper\n- Can create complex weapon and tool shapes\n\n**Historical impact:**\n- Bronze was so superior that an entire historical period is named the \"Bronze Age\"\n- Civilizations with bronze technology had military and technological advantages\n\n**3. Why bronze properties are adjustable but pure copper's are not:**\n\n**Bronze (Mixture) - ADJUSTABLE:**\n\n**a) Variable composition:**\n- Bronze is a **mixture** with no fixed ratio\n- Can contain 5-25% tin (rest copper)\n- Different ratios create different properties:\n  - **High tin** (20-25%): Very hard, brittle - good for bells, cymbals\n  - **Medium tin** (10-15%): Strong, tough - ideal for weapons, tools\n  - **Low tin** (5-8%): More ductile - good for decorative items, coins\n\n**b) Flexibility in design:**\n- Metallurgists can **adjust composition** to match specific needs\n- Want harder bronze? Add more tin\n- Want more workable bronze? Add less tin\n- Can also add other metals (zinc, aluminum) for other properties\n\n**c) Mixture principle:**\n- Mixtures have **variable composition** by definition\n- Properties are **intermediate** and adjustable based on ratio\n- Each batch can be customized\n\n**Pure Copper (Element) - FIXED:**\n\n**a) Cannot change composition:**\n- Pure copper is an **element** - contains only copper atoms\n- **Cannot change** the fundamental nature of copper atoms\n- Can't make copper \"harder\" by changing its composition - there's nothing to change!\n\n**b) Fixed properties:**\n- All pure copper samples have **identical properties** (when pure)\n- Softness, conductivity, melting point, etc. are **inherent** to copper atoms\n- These are **intrinsic properties** determined by copper's atomic structure\n\n**c) Limited modifications:**\n- Can only change properties through **physical processing**:\n  - Work hardening (hammering)\n  - Heat treatment (annealing)\n  - These changes are temporary or limited\n- Cannot fundamentally alter the element's nature\n\n**Summary comparison:**\n\n| Feature | Pure Copper (Element) | Bronze (Alloy/Mixture) |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Composition | Fixed (100% Cu) | Variable (Cu + Sn ratio) |\n| Properties | Fixed, cannot adjust | Adjustable by ratio |\n| Hardness | Soft (inherent) | Hard (customizable) |\n| Customization | None (it's an element) | High (change tin %) |\n| Application | Limited (too soft) | Versatile (tune for use) |\n\n**Key principle:** Mixtures (like alloys) can be engineered with variable compositions to achieve desired properties, while elements have fixed properties determined by their atomic structure. This is why alloys revolutionized technology - they allow humans to design materials with specific characteristics by adjusting mixture ratios.",
