    "solution": "**Any ONE of the following explanations is acceptable:**\n\n---\n\n**Scenario 1: Skin healing (Phenomenon p1)**\n\nCell structures involved:\n\n1. **Nucleus**: Contains DNA with instructions for cell division. When skin is damaged, the nucleus activates genes that trigger cell division to produce new skin cells.\n\n2. **Cell membrane**: Controls what enters and exits cells. During healing, the membrane allows nutrients and growth factors to enter cells, providing materials needed for growth and repair.\n\nHow it works: The nucleus detects the injury signal and initiates cell division. New daughter cells are produced with identical DNA. These cells migrate to fill the gap, eventually closing the wound.\n\n---\n\n**Scenario 2: Leaves appearing green (Phenomenon p4)**\n\nCell structures involved:\n\n1. **Chloroplasts**: Contain chlorophyll (green pigment) that absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis. When light hits chloroplasts, the chlorophyll reflects green wavelengths, making leaves appear green.\n\n2. **Cell wall**: The transparent cell wall in leaf cells allows light to pass through to reach the chloroplasts inside.\n\nHow it works: Light passes through the transparent cell wall and reaches chloroplasts. Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light but reflects green, making the leaf appear green to our eyes.\n\n---\n\n**Scenario 3: Plant stems standing upright**\n\nCell structures involved:\n\n1. **Cell wall**: Rigid structure made of cellulose provides strength and prevents cells from collapsing under their own weight.\n\n2. **Large central vacuole**: When filled with water, creates internal pressure (turgor pressure) that pushes against the cell wall, making cells rigid and firm.\n\nHow it works: Water in the vacuole creates pressure, pushing the cell membrane against the cell wall. The rigid cell wall resists this pressure. Millions of turgid (firm) cells stacked together create a strong, upright structure - no bones needed!",
