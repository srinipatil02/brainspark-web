      "solution": "**Solution:**\n\n**Scale factor for servings:**\n12/8 = 1.5 times the recipe\n\n**If original butter = 1 part:**\nFor 8 servings: butter = 1 part\nFor 12 servings: butter = 1.5 parts\n\n**Find actual butter needed:**\nTotal parts in original = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 parts\nNeed to find original amounts... but we can use ratio directly.\n\n**Alternative:** We need butter in proportion to servings.\nLet original butter = B\nFor 12 servings: butter needed = B × 1.5\n\n**From the ratio:** In any batch, butter:total = 1:7\nFor 12 servings, total mix scales by 1.5\n\n**Actually, check if 300g is enough for 12:**\n300g available for butter\nOriginal recipe butter (8 serve) needs calculating from context.\n\nSince no original amounts given, the question asks if 300g butter is enough.\n**Assume original recipe has quantities such that 1 part = some amount.**\n\nLet 1 part = x grams\n12 serve needs 1.5x butter\nIf 1.5x ≤ 300, then enough.\n\n**Reinterpreting:** The ratio tells us proportions, need more information.\n\n**Better approach:** \n300g butter as the limiting factor.\n300g butter = 1 part (scaled)\nSo 1 scaled part = 300g\nThis makes flour = 4 × 300 = 1200g, sugar = 600g\nTotal = 2100g for the batch using 300g butter.\n\nThis would make 8 servings if 300g = 1 part.\nFor 12 servings, need 1.5 × 300 = 450g butter.\n\n**Answer: No, 300g is not enough.
