    "content": "The village elders said Mei was foolish. A bridge across the Dragon's Throat? Impossible. The ravine was too wide, the winds too fierce, the wood too precious. Her father had tried twenty years ago and failed. Why should his daughter succeed?\n\nMei listened to their objections with the same quiet attention she gave to the wind patterns and the behaviour of the ancient pines. She had been watching the ravine since she was seven years old—not with her father's engineering drawings, but with the patient observation of someone who wanted to understand rather than conquer.\n\n'The wind doesn't fight the bridge,' she told the elders. 'The wind shows the bridge where to bend.'\n\nThey shook their heads. Mei's father had been a respected engineer, educated in the city, armed with formulas and calculations. He had fought the wind with rigid beams and precise angles, and the wind had won. What could his daughter—a girl who spent her days watching trees—possibly know that he hadn't?\n\nBut Mei had learned something in her years of watching that her father never had time to see. The ancient pines that grew at the ravine's edge didn't stand straight against the wind. They curved, they bowed, they let the gusts pass through their branches. The ones that tried to stand rigid were the ones that broke.\n\nShe didn't argue with the elders. Instead, she began building.\n\nHer bridge was nothing like her father's design. Where he had used heavy timber, she used rope. Where he had built rigid platforms, she created sections that could shift and sway. The village children gathered to watch, whispering that the bridge looked like it was made of spider silk and hope.\n\nWhen the first storm came, the elders waited for the collapse. They had seen her father's bridge tear itself apart in such weather, its unyielding frame no match for the ravine's violence.\n\nBut Mei's bridge did something different. It danced. The ropes swayed and the platforms tilted, but nothing broke. The bridge moved WITH the wind, absorbing its force instead of fighting it.\n\nAfter the storm passed, Elder Wu crossed to the other side—the first person to do so in twenty years. When he returned, his eyes were wet.\n\n'Your father,' he said quietly, 'would not understand this bridge. He would call it too flexible, too uncertain.'\n\n'I know,' Mei said.\n\n'But he would be proud of you anyway.'\n\nMei thought about her father, about his careful drawings and his absolute certainty. She had loved watching him work, even as she sensed something missing in his approach. He had seen the ravine as a problem to solve with force. She had learned to see it as a conversation to join.\n\n'I didn't build this bridge to prove him wrong,' she said finally. 'I built it because the people on the other side needed a way home.'\n\nElder Wu nodded. 'That,' he said, 'is exactly why it worked.'\n\nThe wind picked up again, and the bridge swayed gently—not fighting, not breaking, just being exactly what it needed to be.",
