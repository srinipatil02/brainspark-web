    "content": "The demolition notice had been posted for three months, but somehow it still felt sudden when the day arrived. Mrs Webb stood at the circulation desk for the last time, watching volunteers pack books into cardboard boxes.\n\n'They're building a technology centre,' the mayor had explained at the town meeting. 'A state-of-the-art facility with computers, interactive screens, virtual learning pods. Everything the modern community needs.'\n\nNo one had argued. How do you argue against the future?\n\nBut as Mrs Webb watched the shelves empty, she thought about all the things that couldn't be packed into boxes. The corner where Mr Hendricks had read the newspaper every morning for fifteen years, talking to no one but seeming less alone just by being there. The children's section where three generations of the Patel family had learned to read. The window seat where teenagers had hidden from the world, or found themselves, or both.\n\nThe new technology centre would have better lighting. Faster internet. Cleaner bathrooms. It would offer coding classes and 3D printing workshops and resume-building seminars. It would be everything a modern community needed.\n\nMrs Webb wondered what Mr Hendricks would do with a coding class.\n\nShe found herself thinking about her grandmother, who had worked in this same building sixty years ago. 'A library isn't really about books,' her grandmother had once said. 'It's about the space between the books—the quiet places where people can figure things out.'\n\nThe technology centre would have many things. She wasn't sure it would have quiet places.\n\nA little girl wandered in—couldn't be more than six—holding her mother's hand. The girl looked around at the chaos of boxes and stripped shelves with wide, confused eyes.\n\n'Are all the stories going away?' she asked.\n\nMrs Webb knelt down to her level. 'The stories are moving to a new place,' she said. It was true, technically. The collection would be split between the new centre and the regional library forty minutes away.\n\n'But I like THIS place,' the girl said.\n\nMrs Webb felt something crack behind her carefully maintained composure. 'I know, sweetheart. I do too.'\n\nThe mother pulled the girl gently toward the door. 'Say goodbye to the library, Emma.'\n\n'Goodbye, library,' Emma whispered. And then, quieter still, 'I'll remember you.'\n\nAfter they left, Mrs Webb stood alone among the boxes. Tomorrow, the bulldozers would come. The technology centre would rise, modern and bright, full of everything a community could want.\n\nBut she found herself wondering: in their rush to build the future, had anyone asked what of the past was worth keeping? Progress wasn't wrong—she believed in computers and coding and all the possibilities they offered. But some things couldn't be upgraded. Some things could only be lost.\n\nShe picked up the last book on the donation cart—a battered copy of 'The Velveteen Rabbit'—and tucked it into her bag. The book was about becoming real through love, through being worn and used and needed.\n\nThe library had been real.\n\nShe hoped that was worth something, even if no one had thought to measure it.",
