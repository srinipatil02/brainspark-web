    "content": "The birds had stopped coming to Grandmother's garden three years ago, but she still filled the feeder every morning. I watched her from the kitchen window, scattering seeds into the empty air.\n\n'They'll come back,' she said when I finally asked. 'Things always come back when you keep making space for them.'\n\nThe garden had changed since Grandfather died. The vegetable patches had gone wild, tomato cages rusting into strange sculptures. The roses she used to prune with mathematical precision now sprawled in every direction, their thorns catching sunlight. Only the bird feeder remained the same—cleaned weekly, filled daily, its perch worn smooth from years of tiny feet that no longer visited.\n\n'Maybe if we put up new feeders,' I suggested. 'Different colours, different seeds.'\n\nGrandmother smiled in that way she had when I was being young and helpful but missing the point. 'It's not about the feeders, love.'\n\nI was sixteen and impatient with things that didn't make sense. 'Then what is it about?'\n\nShe was quiet for a long time, her weathered hands still on the bag of seeds. 'When your grandfather was alive, I used to watch him with these birds. He'd stand here for hours, perfectly still, waiting for them to trust him. He never rushed. Never demanded. Just... offered, and waited.'\n\n'But he's gone now,' I said, more gently than I'd intended.\n\n'Yes.' She lifted another handful of seeds. 'But the offering isn't really about the birds, is it? It's about who I become while I'm offering. Patient. Hopeful. Still believing in things that might not happen.'\n\nI thought about that for weeks afterward. The way she found the seedlings in the wild tomato patch and didn't uproot them. The way she let the roses grow past their borders, creating spaces no one had planned. The way she kept filling a feeder for birds that might never return.\n\n'What happens if they never come back?' I asked her one evening.\n\n'Then I'll have spent my last years practicing hope,' she said. 'That's not nothing.'\n\nGrandmother died the following spring. I inherited the house, the wild garden, the empty bird feeder. My first instinct was to fix things—replant the vegetables, prune the roses, take down the useless feeder.\n\nBut I found myself filling it instead. Every morning, like she had. Scattering seeds into empty air. Not because I believed the birds would come back, but because the action itself had become something else—a way of being in the world. Patient. Hopeful. Still believing.\n\nThe birds never did return.\n\nBut I discovered she was right about one thing: the offering changes you, whether or not it's accepted. Some mornings, standing where she stood, I could feel myself becoming the kind of person who makes space for things that might not happen. Who practices hope like a daily discipline.\n\nThat, I learned, is its own kind of arrival.",
