    "content": "The light swept across the harbour every seventeen seconds, as regular as Marcus's heartbeat. He had counted it so many times that his body had learned to anticipate each flash, the way a musician knows when the next beat will fall. Thirty-two years he had kept this light burning, and in all that time, the beam had never faltered.\n\nFrom his perch at the top of the spiral staircase, Marcus could see the whole town spread out below like a child's model village. The fishing boats, tiny as toys, bobbed at their moorings. The townspeople moved through their daily routines, oblivious to the eyes watching from above. They respected him, in their way—always tipping their hats when they glimpsed his silhouette against the sky, nodding gravely as if acknowledging an unspoken agreement. But they never lingered. No one climbed the one hundred and thirty-seven steps to share a cup of tea or to ask about the weather.\n\nMarcus preferred it this way. At least, that was what he told himself during the long winter nights when the wind howled like a wounded animal and the only company was the steady sweep of the beam. A lighthouse keeper needed solitude the way a fish needed water. Distraction meant danger—a moment's inattention could leave ships to founder on the hidden rocks that lurked beneath the harbour's deceptively calm surface.\n\nYet sometimes, in the grey hours before dawn, Marcus would take out the small wooden box he kept beneath his bed. Inside lay a collection of objects that seemed unremarkable to anyone who might stumble upon them: a child's marble, worn smooth with age; a faded photograph of a woman with laughing eyes; a letter, folded so many times the creases had nearly worn through; and a silver locket that Marcus had never opened, not once in thirty-two years.\n\nHe would hold these treasures in his calloused hands, not looking at them but feeling their weight, their texture, their silent testimony to a life he had chosen to leave behind. The marble had been his son's favourite. The photograph captured his wife on their wedding day. The letter—but the letter he couldn't bear to think about. And the locket held a mystery he wasn't ready to solve.\n\nWhen the first rays of sunlight crept over the horizon, Marcus would carefully return each item to its place, close the lid, and slide the box back into its hiding spot. Then he would climb the stairs to extinguish the light, check the mechanisms, and prepare for another day of watching.\n\nThe townspeople saw him as a guardian, a protector who kept the darkness at bay. They didn't know—couldn't know—that the lighthouse keeper had his own darkness to tend. That some lights are easier to keep burning than others. That the real secrets aren't hidden in locked boxes but in the spaces between heartbeats, in the seventeen-second pause between one sweep of the beam and the next.",
