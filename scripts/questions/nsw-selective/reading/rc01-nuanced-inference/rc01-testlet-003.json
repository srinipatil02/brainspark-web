    "content": "Every evening, across thousands of Australian homes, a familiar battle unfolds. Children slump at kitchen tables, parents hover anxiously, and the evening hours—those precious few between school and sleep—disappear into worksheets and textbook chapters. We call this ritual 'homework,' and we accept it as an essential part of education. But what if everything we believe about homework is wrong?\n\nConsider the evidence. A landmark study by Professor Harris Cooper analysed over 180 research studies on homework spanning several decades. His conclusion might surprise the parents currently supervising times tables practice: for primary school students, homework provides no measurable academic benefit. None. The hours spent on worksheets could just as well be spent staring at clouds, and the educational outcome would be identical.\n\nDefenders of homework often argue that it teaches responsibility and time management. This sounds reasonable until you examine it closely. We don't ask surgeons to practice operations at home, or pilots to simulate landings in their living rooms. We understand that certain skills belong in certain environments, taught by trained professionals. Why, then, do we expect children to become independent learners by completing tasks at home without teacher guidance—tasks that often frustrate rather than enlighten?\n\nThe hidden cost of homework extends beyond wasted time. Family relationships suffer when parents become unwilling enforcers of academic compliance. Children who struggle with schoolwork experience that struggle again at home, eroding their confidence and their love of learning. Meanwhile, students from privileged backgrounds receive help that others cannot access, turning homework into an engine of inequality rather than excellence.\n\nPerhaps most troublingly, homework crowds out activities that genuinely benefit children's development. Free play, which researchers increasingly recognise as essential for creativity and emotional regulation, shrinks with every assigned worksheet. Family conversations—the real foundation of language development and critical thinking—give way to tense negotiations about mathematics problems neither parent nor child fully understands.\n\nYet we continue this practice, decade after decade, because questioning homework feels like questioning education itself. Teachers assign it because parents expect it. Parents expect it because schools assign it. And children, caught in this cycle of assumption, lose hours of their childhood to a tradition that serves no one well.\n\nI am not suggesting that learning should stop at the school gates. Curious children naturally explore ideas at home—reading for pleasure, conducting kitchen experiments, asking questions about the world. This self-directed exploration is valuable precisely because it is chosen, not compelled. The difference between a child who reads because she loves stories and a child who reads because there will be a quiz tomorrow is the difference between nurturing a lifelong learner and training a reluctant task-completer.\n\nThe question we should ask is not 'How much homework?' but 'Why homework at all?' Until we can answer that question with evidence rather than assumption, perhaps the bravest thing schools could do is simply stop. Give families back their evenings. Trust that children who are engaged at school will continue learning at home—not because they must, but because they want to.",
