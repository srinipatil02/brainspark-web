    "content": "Zara pressed her back against the brick wall of the science building, watching the groups flow past like schools of fish that somehow knew which direction to swim. Everyone else seemed to understand invisible rules she hadn't learned yet. Which door to use. Where to stand. Who to sit near without having to ask.\n\nIt was her third school in two years—her father's job kept the family moving like pieces on a board game. She had become an expert at new beginnings, though not in the way people might assume. Being new didn't get easier with practice. It just got lonelier, because each time she lost not just a place but the hope that any place could ever feel permanent.\n\nA girl with paint-stained fingers broke away from a passing group and approached her. Zara had noticed her in art class, the way she talked with her hands and laughed without checking first if anyone was watching.\n\n'You're new,' the girl said. It wasn't a question.\n\n'Third school in two years,' Zara heard herself reply, and immediately wished she could grab the words back. She had learned long ago not to share that information. It made people look at her differently—with pity, or worse, with the kind of interested sympathy that would fade in a week when they realised she might be moving again.\n\nBut the girl just nodded, as if this were the most ordinary thing she'd ever heard. 'I've been at this school since Year 3. Same classroom, same faces, same everything.' She paused. 'Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to start fresh somewhere no one knows who you were in Year 4.'\n\n'Who were you in Year 4?'\n\n'I cried during a maths test because I didn't understand fractions.' The girl grinned. 'Bella Chen has not let me forget it for three years. What about you? What did you leave behind at your last school?'\n\nZara thought about the question—really thought about it, instead of giving her usual practised response about friends and good teachers. What had she left behind? A half-finished mural in the art room that someone else would paint over. A library book she'd forgotten to return. The beginning of a friendship with a girl named Jasmine that had ended before it had properly started.\n\n'Nothing that mattered,' she said, and this time she meant something different by those words than she ever had before. All the things she'd left weren't lost treasures—they were seeds that never got to grow.\n\n'Well,' the girl said, extending her paint-stained hand, 'I'm Sofia. And this is the part where you could tell me your name and we could maybe sit together at lunch, if you want. Or not. No pressure. I just thought you looked like someone who might like to know which door doesn't stick.'\n\nZara took the offered hand. It was warm and slightly sticky with acrylic paint. 'Zara,' she said. 'And yes. I would like to know about the door.'\n\nSomewhere in the back of her mind, a small voice whispered that this would end too—that she would move again, that Sofia would become another name in a list of almost-friends. But for now, the paint on her hand felt like a promise, and promises, she was learning, could be worth making even when they couldn't be kept forever.",
