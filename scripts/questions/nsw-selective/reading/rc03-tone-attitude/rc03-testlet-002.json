    "content": "I found the letters in a shoebox at the back of the wardrobe, bundled with a rubber band that crumbled when I touched it. The paper was thin, almost translucent, the handwriting careful and slanted in a way nobody writes anymore.\n\nMy grandfather died before I was born. I know him only through photographs where he's always squinting into sunlight, and through these letters—forty-seven of them, written to my grandmother during the war.\n\nThe early letters are bright with hope. 'I'll be home by Christmas,' he promises in August 1942. 'Save me a piece of your mother's fruitcake.' He writes about the jokes his mates tell, the card games that pass the time, the strange beauty of desert stars. Reading these, I can almost hear him laughing.\n\nBut the letters change. By 1943, the sentences grow shorter. The jokes disappear. 'Don't worry about me,' he writes, which my grandmother must have known meant exactly the opposite. He asks about home with an intensity that aches: 'Is the rosebush still blooming? Has the Henderson boy come back yet? What colour did you paint the kitchen?'\n\nI understand now why my grandmother kept these letters but never showed them to anyone. They're too intimate, too raw. In one, written in shaky handwriting unlike his usual careful script, he simply writes: 'I am tired, Eleanor. So very tired.' No explanation, no details. My grandmother wouldn't have needed any.\n\nThe last letter is dated March 1944. 'Whatever happens,' he writes, 'know that these years of loving you have been worth every difficulty. You gave me something to come home to. Even if home becomes just a word, it was real because of you.'\n\nHe did come home, eventually. But my mother says he was different—quieter, more careful with his words, as if speech had become something precious that shouldn't be wasted. My grandmother never spoke about the war years, and now I understand that silence too. Some things are too heavy for everyday conversation.\n\nI put the letters back in their box, but I kept one thing: a photograph that had been tucked inside the last envelope. My grandfather, young and grinning, holding a sign that reads 'See you soon, Eleanor.' He's giving a thumbs-up, his eyes crinkled with a smile I've never seen in later photographs.\n\nI don't know who that young man with the easy smile became. I know only who he was afterward—the quiet man my mother remembers, the careful handwriting that still slants across these fragile pages. But I'm glad he existed once, bright and hopeful under desert stars.",
