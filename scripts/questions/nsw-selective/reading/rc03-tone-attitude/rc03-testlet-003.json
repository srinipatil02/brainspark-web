    "content": "Mrs Yamamoto was retiring after thirty-seven years, and nobody quite knew how to say goodbye. She had been ancient when I started high school—or so it seemed to my thirteen-year-old eyes—and she was ancient still, though I now understood that her silver hair and lined face had nothing to do with her energy.\n\nOn her last day, she gathered us in the art room one final time. The walls were bare now, stripped of the student work that had always hung there in vibrant chaos. The emptiness felt wrong, like a mouth missing teeth.\n\nShe didn't give a speech about following your dreams or believing in yourself. Mrs Yamamoto had never been one for inspirational clichés. Instead, she walked to the centre of the room and picked up a piece of charcoal.\n\n'Art isn't about talent,' she said, beginning to sketch on the large paper pinned to the easel. Her strokes were quick, confident, careless in a way that made them beautiful. 'Talent is something people talk about when they don't want to admit that practice and attention matter more.'\n\nShe was drawing a bird—not a perfect bird, but a bird in motion, caught mid-flight. As we watched, she made what most teachers would call a mistake: a line went wrong, veered where it shouldn't have.\n\n'You see that?' She pointed to the errant line. 'Most of you would erase this. Start over. Try to make it perfect.' She smiled, the creases around her eyes deepening. 'I'm going to leave it. And now watch.'\n\nShe kept drawing, and somehow the mistake became part of the bird—a shadow, a suggestion of wind, something that made the image more alive than any perfect line could.\n\n'This is what I want you to remember,' she said, stepping back from the easel. 'Not despite the mistakes, but through them. Every wrong line is a door. Whether it leads somewhere interesting depends on whether you're brave enough to walk through it.'\n\nThe bell rang then, cutting off whatever else she might have said. Students gathered their bags, some lingering awkwardly, unsure whether to thank her or simply leave. Mrs Yamamoto didn't seem to mind either way. She stood looking at her imperfect bird, and I could have sworn she was proud of it.\n\nI kept that lesson longer than I kept any fact about colour theory or perspective. Twenty years later, when my own lines go wrong—in art, in life—I still hear her voice: brave enough to walk through it.\n\nThe walls of that art room are hung with different work now. Different teacher, different students. But somewhere in the paint-splattered floors, I like to think, a trace of Mrs Yamamoto remains.",
