Actually: Subtract equations: 1 apple - 1 orange = $1. Add equations: 7(a+o) = $37, not divisible. Try: From subtraction, a = o + 1. Sub in eq1: 4(o+1) + 3o = 19, 7o + 4 = 19, o = $15/7... Wait, let me recalculate. 4a + 3o = 19, 3a + 4o = 18. Subtract: a - o = 1. Add: 7a + 7o = 37. From a = o + 1: 7(o+1) + 7o = 37? No, 7a + 7o = 37. So a + o = 37/7... Hmm. Let me try: a - o = 1, so a = o + 1. 4(o+1) + 3o = 19 → 4o + 4 + 3o = 19 → 7o = 15... not whole. I need to recalculate with whole numbers. Let me assume a = 3, o = 2: 4(3) + 3(2) = 12 + 6 = 18 ≠ 19. Try a = 3.5, o = 2.5? Not appropriate for Year 6. Let me use a = 3, o = 7/3... Actually for this problem: If 4a + 3o = 19 and 3a + 4o = 18, subtracting gives a - o = 1. If a = 3 and o = 2: 4(3) + 3(2) = 18, 3(3) + 4(2) = 17. Doesn't work. Let me try a = 4, o = 1: 4(4) + 3(1) = 19 ✓, 3(4) + 4(1) = 16 ✗. Try a = 2.5, o = 3: 4(2.5) + 3(3) = 19 ✓, 3(2.5) + 4(3) = 19.5 ✗. The correct answer with these equations: a - o = 1, 7a + 7o = 37, so a + o = 37/7 ≈ 5.29. a = 3.14, o = 2.14. Not clean. I need to fix the numbers. Let me use: 4a + 3o = 22, 3a + 4o = 20. Sub: a - o = 2. Add: 7a + 7o = 42, a + o = 6. So 2a = 8, a = 4, o = 2. Better! But I already wrote 19 and 18.

Try: 3C = 35, C ≈ $11.67... Actually with C = 10: T = 25, J = 65, Total = 100. With C = 5: T = 20, J = 60, Total = 85. Hmm, let me recalculate. If 3C + 70 = 105, then 3C = 35, C = 35/3 ≈ $11.67. Not clean. Let me adjust: Jacket = T-shirt + 40, T-shirt = Cap + 15, so Jacket = Cap + 55. Total = J + T + C = (C+55) + (C+15) + C = 3C + 70 = 105. C = 35/3. This gives non-integer.
