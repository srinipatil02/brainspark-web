Let me recalculate.\n\nActually: 64 down + 32 up + 32 down + 16 up + 16 down + 8 up + 8 down + 4 up = 64 + 32×2 + 16×2 + 8×2 + 4 = 64 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 4 = 180.\n\nHmm, let me check answer A = 120. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nIf 4th bounce up = 4, then: Drop 64, up 32 down 32, up 16 down 16, up 8 down 8, up 4 = 64 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 4 = 180.\n\nBut if heights are: 64, 32, 16, 8, 4 (each half):\n- Drop from 64 → travel 64 down\n- Bounce 1: up 32, down 32 → 64\n- Bounce 2: up 16, down 16 → 32\n- Bounce 3: up 8, down 8 → 16\n- Bounce 4: up 4 → 4\n\nTotal: 64 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 4 = 180\n\nSo answer should be 180, not 120. Let me fix this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking just for bounces 1-4 not including initial drop?\n32+32+16+16+8+8+4 = 116... not 120.\n\nOr just up distances: 32+16+8+4 = 60, doubled = 120... that could be it if we ignore the initial drop and count up+down for each bounce height.\n\nLet me reframe the question to match 120:\n- Perhaps \"4th bounce going up\" means after 4 full bounces?\n- Or the sequence 64, 32, 16, 8 where sum = 120 and that's 4 terms?\n\nActually if the answer is 120: 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 = 120. That's 4 heights. But that's only down distances or only up+initial.\n\nI'll adjust the problem to make 120 correct: \"What is the total distance the ball falls (downward only) in its first 4 drops?\" Then 64+32+16+8 = 120.\n\nLet me rewrite the question.",
