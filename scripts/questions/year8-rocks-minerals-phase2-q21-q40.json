    "stem": "Geologists in the field often perform a **streak test** by rubbing minerals on an unglazed porcelain tile to see the color of the powder.\n\n**Real-world scenario**: You're at a mine site identifying ore minerals. You need to distinguish between two similar-looking metallic minerals:\n- **Hematite** (iron ore): Appears black/grey, but streak is **reddish-brown**\n- **Magnetite** (also iron ore): Appears black, streak is **black**\n\nBoth look nearly identical to the eye and both are magnetic. Without a streak test, they're hard to tell apart.\n\n**Question**: Explain why the **streak test** is particularly valuable in this real-world situation. Why would visual inspection alone be unreliable?",
    "solution": "The **streak test** is particularly valuable in this situation because:\n\n**1. Visual inspection is unreliable**:\n- Both **hematite** and **magnetite** appear **black/dark grey** on the surface\n- Surface color can be affected by:\n  - **Weathering** (oxidation, exposure to elements)\n  - **Impurities** mixed into the crystal structure\n  - **Surface coatings** (dust, dirt, other minerals)\n- Looking at them, you **cannot reliably distinguish** them\n\n**2. Streak reveals true identity**:\n- **Streak shows the true mineral color** (color of powder)\n- When you powder the mineral (streak test), you reveal its **inherent color** without interference\n- **Hematite**: streak is **reddish-brown** (from Fe₂O₃ composition)\n- **Magnetite**: streak is **black** (from Fe₃O₄ composition)\n- The streak difference is **dramatic and diagnostic**\n\n**3. Practical importance**:\n- Both are **iron ores**, but have different:\n  - Iron content\n  - Processing requirements\n  - Economic value\n- **Correct identification** is critical for:\n  - Mining operations (which ore body to extract)\n  - Processing (different refining methods)\n  - Economic assessment (different values)\n\n**Real-world application**: At a mine site, a geologist can quickly and reliably identify which iron ore is present using just a porcelain plate - no expensive laboratory equipment needed!
