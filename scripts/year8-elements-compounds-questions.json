All matter is made up of atoms\n2. Atoms cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means\n3.

      "solution": "**Calcium compound in bones:**\n\n**Calcium phosphate: Ca₃(PO₄)₂** (and also calcium carbonate: CaCO₃)\n\nThese calcium compounds form a hard crystal structure called **hydroxyapatite** in bones and teeth.\n\n**Why compound instead of pure element?**\n\n**1. Pure calcium is dangerously reactive**:\n- Pure calcium metal reacts violently with water\n- Would react with fluids in your body\n- Could cause serious damage\n- **Unsafe** for living tissue\n\n**2. Compounds are stable**:\n- Calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate are **stable** and **non-reactive**\n- Don't react with body fluids\n- **Safe** to store in the body\n\n**3. Compounds have the right properties**:\n- Calcium phosphate is **hard** and **strong** - perfect for bones\n- Provides structural support\n- Pure calcium metal would be too soft and reactive\n\n**4. Compounds can be easily used**:\n- Your body can break down compounds when it needs calcium\n- Releases Ca²⁺ ions gradually for muscle function, nerves, etc.\n- Controlled release, not dangerous reaction\n\n**Analogy**: It's like storing gasoline (safe liquid) instead of explosive gas - same atoms, but safer form!\n\n**Summary**: Pure elements are often reactive and dangerous. Compounds are stable and safe, with properties perfect for biological functions. Nature is smart!",

      "solution": "**Why nitrogen gas (N₂) is unusable:**\n\n**The problem: Triple bond**\n\n- Nitrogen gas exists as **N₂** molecules\n- Two nitrogen atoms are connected by a **triple bond** (N≡N)\n- Triple bonds are **extremely strong** and hard to break\n- Living things don't have enough energy to break this bond\n- So N₂ just passes through lungs and plant roots unused!\n\n**How nitrogen must be converted (\"nitrogen fixation\"):**\n\n**Natural methods:**\n\n**1. Lightning**:\n- Provides enough energy to break N₂ bonds\n- Combines nitrogen with oxygen → nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂)\n- Dissolves in rain → nitrates (NO₃⁻) in soil\n- Plants can absorb nitrates!\n\n**2. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria**:\n- Special bacteria in soil (and in root nodules of legumes like peas, beans)\n- Contain enzymes that can break N≡N bond\n- Convert N₂ → ammonia (NH₃) → ammonium (NH₄⁺)\n- Plants absorb ammonium and nitrates from soil\n\n**Human method:**\n\n**3. Haber process (making fertilizer)**:\n- Industrial process: N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃ (ammonia)\n- Requires high temperature (450°C) and pressure\n- Ammonia converted to fertilizers (ammonium nitrate, urea)\n- Farmers add to soil for plants\n\n**Why compounds work:**\n- Nitrogen in compounds (NH₃, NO₃⁻, NH₄⁺) has **weaker bonds**\n- Plants and animals can use these to build:\n  - **Proteins** (for muscles, enzymes)\n  - **DNA** (genetic material)\n  - **Chlorophyll** (for photosynthesis)\n\n**Summary**: Pure N₂ is locked up by triple bonds. It must be converted to nitrogen compounds (by lightning, bacteria, or industry) before life can use it. This is the **nitrogen cycle**!",
