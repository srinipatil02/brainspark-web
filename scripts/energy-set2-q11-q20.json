      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "solution": "Heat and temperature are related but different concepts. Heat is the total thermal energy in an object - it depends on how many particles there are and how fast they're moving. Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of the particles - how fast they're typically moving. Think of it this way: a cup of hot water and a bathtub of hot water might have the same temperature (particles moving at the same average speed), but the bathtub contains much more heat because it has many more particles. Temperature tells us how hot something feels, while heat tells us the total amount of thermal energy present.",

      "solution": "Telephone wires are left loose to allow for thermal expansion. When temperature increases on hot days, the metal wires expand and get longer. If the wires were stretched tight, they would have no room to expand and could snap or pull the poles over. In cold weather, the wires contract and get shorter, which is why they appear tighter. The loose installation provides slack so the wires can safely expand and contract with temperature changes without breaking. This is an important practical application of thermal expansion that engineers must consider when designing infrastructure in Australia's varying climate.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "solution": "The metal spoon heats up primarily through conduction. Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid material when particles collide with neighbouring particles, passing energy along. In metals, this happens very efficiently because metals have free-moving electrons that can carry energy quickly. The heat from the hot tea at the bottom of the spoon causes particles to vibrate more rapidly, and these vibrations are passed from particle to particle up through the metal handle. This is why the entire spoon eventually becomes warm, even the end that isn't touching the liquid. Metals are excellent thermal conductors, which is why we need to be careful with metal utensils in hot drinks.",

      "stem": "Explain why coastal areas in Australia often experience sea breezes during the day. Include the term 'convection' in your answer.",
      "solution": "Sea breezes occur due to convection currents caused by different heating rates of land and water. During the day, the sun heats both the land and the ocean. Land heats up much faster than water because it has a lower specific heat capacity. The hot land heats the air above it, causing the air to expand, become less dense, and rise. This creates a low-pressure area over the land. Meanwhile, the air over the cooler ocean remains denser and at higher pressure. The cooler, denser ocean air moves in toward the land to replace the rising warm air, creating a sea breeze. This convection cycle continues as long as the land remains warmer than the ocean, which is why sea breezes are common on warm Australian afternoons.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "solution": "Air trapped in foam is the best thermal insulator among these options. Insulators are materials that slow down heat transfer. Air is naturally a poor conductor of heat because its particles are spread far apart and don't collide frequently enough to transfer energy efficiently. When air is trapped in small pockets within foam, it cannot move to create convection currents, making it an excellent insulator. This is why materials like polystyrene foam, foam drink cups, and insulation in walls contain trapped air. In contrast, copper, steel, and aluminium are all metals, which are excellent thermal conductors due to their free-moving electrons. These metals would allow heat to transfer rapidly and are therefore poor insulators.",

      "solution": "Thick fabric oven mitts are more effective because they contain more trapped air between the fibres, making them better thermal insulators. The thickness provides multiple layers of material with air pockets throughout. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so these trapped air spaces slow down the heat transfer from the hot oven dish to your hand. Thin cotton has fewer air pockets and less material for the heat to travel through, so heat transfers more quickly to your hand. Additionally, the thickness increases the distance heat must travel, giving it more time to dissipate. This is why thick oven mitts can protect you from hot objects while thin fabric would let too much heat through and burn you.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "solution": "Heat from the Sun reaches Earth through radiation. Radiation is the transfer of energy as electromagnetic waves (including infrared light and visible light) that can travel through empty space. Unlike conduction and convection, radiation doesn't need particles or a medium to travel through. The space between the Sun and Earth is a near-vacuum with very few particles, so conduction and convection cannot occur. The Sun emits electromagnetic radiation that travels through space at the speed of light. When this radiation reaches Earth, it's absorbed by the atmosphere, land, and oceans, warming them up. This is the only way heat can transfer through the vacuum of space, which is why radiation is so important for life on Earth.",

      "solution": "A liquid-in-glass thermometer contains a liquid (usually coloured alcohol or mercury) in a sealed glass tube with a bulb at the bottom and a narrow tube above it. When the thermometer is placed in a warm environment, the liquid in the bulb absorbs heat energy. This causes the liquid particles to move faster and spread further apart, making the liquid expand and take up more space. Because the bulb and narrow tube are sealed, the only place for the expanding liquid to go is up the narrow tube. The higher the temperature, the more the liquid expands and the higher it rises. The tube has markings that correspond to specific temperatures. When the liquid cools, particles slow down and move closer together, causing the liquid to contract and fall back down the tube.",

      "solution": "Water throughout the pan heats primarily through convection currents. Here's how it works: The bottom of the pan heats by conduction from the stove element. Water touching the hot bottom absorbs this heat and warms up. Warm water becomes less dense and rises toward the top. Cooler, denser water from the top sinks to the bottom to replace it. This creates a circular convection current. Hot water rises, cools slightly at the top, sinks back down, gets reheated, and rises again. These continuous convection currents distribute heat throughout the entire pan of water. While conduction does occur between water molecules, it's slow. Convection is much more efficient at heating liquids because the actual movement of the warm water carries heat energy throughout the pan quickly.",

      "solution": "Hot air balloons rise due to thermal expansion and density differences. When the burner heats the air inside the balloon, the air particles gain energy and move faster. As they move faster, they spread further apart, causing the air to expand. This expansion means the same number of particles now occupy a larger volume, making the air less dense (lighter). The cooler air outside the balloon is denser (heavier) because its particles are closer together. According to the principle of buoyancy, less dense objects float in denser fluids. The hot, less dense air inside the balloon is pushed upward by the denser cool air surrounding it, causing the balloon to rise.
