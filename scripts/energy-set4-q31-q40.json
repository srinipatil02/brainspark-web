      "solution": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This is one of the most fundamental laws in physics. When we 'use' energy, we're not destroying it - we're converting it from one form to another. For example, when you ride a bike, chemical energy from your food is converted to kinetic energy of movement, with some becoming heat and sound. The total amount of energy stays the same throughout. This law applies to all energy transformations in the universe, from the tiniest chemical reactions to the largest stars. Understanding this helps us track where energy goes in any system.",

      "solution": "When you clap your hands, chemical energy stored in your muscles (from food) is converted to kinetic energy as your hands move together. When your hands collide, the kinetic energy is transformed into sound energy (the clapping noise) and heat energy (the warmth you feel). According to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy remains constant - it hasn't been created or destroyed, just changed forms. The chemical energy you started with equals the sound energy plus heat energy you end up with. This demonstrates that energy transformations follow the conservation law. The energy hasn't disappeared; it's been redistributed as sound waves traveling through the air and thermal energy warming your hands.",

      "solution": "The pendulum has maximum gravitational potential energy at the highest points of its swing. At these points, the pendulum is at its greatest height above the ground, giving it maximum GPE (GPE = mgh). At this moment, it briefly stops moving, so it has zero kinetic energy. As it swings down, GPE converts to kinetic energy. At the lowest point, GPE is minimum but kinetic energy is maximum (moving fastest). Then as it swings up the other side, kinetic energy converts back to GPE. Throughout the swing, total energy (GPE + KE) remains constant, demonstrating conservation of energy. Energy continuously transforms between potential and kinetic forms.",

      "solution": "First calculate the initial gravitational potential energy:\nGPE = mgh\nGPE = 1 kg × 10 m/s² × 5 m\nGPE = 50 joules\n\nBy the law of conservation of energy, all the GPE converts to kinetic energy as the ball falls.

At the bottom, GPE is minimum but KE is maximum - the car is moving fastest. The total energy (GPE + KE) remains constant throughout, demonstrating conservation of energy.
