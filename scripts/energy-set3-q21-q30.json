      "solution": "The student uses chemical energy stored in their body from food they have eaten. When muscles contract to push the box, chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy (movement). This is why we need to eat food - it provides the chemical energy our bodies use for all activities. The food we eat contains energy that was originally captured from sunlight by plants during photosynthesis. When we digest food, our bodies break down molecules to release this stored chemical energy, which powers muscle contractions and all other body functions.",

      "solution": "When charging a mobile phone, electrical energy from the power point flows through the charging cable to the phone's battery. The charger converts electrical energy from the mains (240V AC) into a lower voltage suitable for the phone. Inside the battery, electrical energy is converted and stored as chemical energy. Some energy is also wasted as heat energy - you may notice the phone or charger gets warm. When you use the phone later, the stored chemical energy in the battery is converted back to electrical energy to power the screen, processor, and other components. This demonstrates that energy can be transferred and transformed between different forms, but the total amount of energy remains constant.",

      "solution": "The crane uses electrical energy to power its motor. The motor converts electrical energy to kinetic energy (movement) as it lifts the beam. As the beam rises higher, it gains gravitational potential energy - energy stored due to its height above the ground. The work done by the crane transfers energy to the beam. Some energy is also wasted as heat due to friction in the crane's machinery and sound energy from the motor. When the beam is at the top, it has maximum gravitational potential energy. If the beam were to fall, this potential energy would convert back to kinetic energy. This demonstrates the law of conservation of energy - energy changes form but is not created or destroyed.",

      "solution": "Power is measured in watts (W). One watt equals one joule of energy transferred per second. So watts = joules ÷ seconds. For example, a 60 W light bulb uses 60 joules of energy every second. A 2000 W kettle uses 2000 joules every second. The higher the wattage, the faster energy is being used or transferred. This is why powerful appliances like kettles, heaters and ovens have high wattage ratings - they transfer large amounts of energy quickly. Understanding power ratings helps us compare how much energy different devices use and estimate electricity costs.",

      "solution": "The motor becomes warm because not all the electrical energy is converted to useful kinetic energy (movement of the fan blades). Some energy is always wasted as heat due to friction between moving parts inside the motor and electrical resistance in the motor's wires. This wasted heat energy makes the motor warm or hot. The motor is not 100% efficient. For example, if a motor is 75% efficient, then 75% of electrical energy becomes kinetic energy while 25% becomes unwanted heat. This is why many motors have cooling fins or fans - to help dissipate the excess heat. All energy transformations produce some waste heat, which is why no device can ever be 100% efficient.",
