    "content": "The envelope arrived three weeks after Grandmother's funeral, addressed to Lily Chen in handwriting she would have recognized anywhere—thin, elegant loops that Grandmother had spent her whole life perfecting.\n\nInside was a single key and a note: 'The workshop. Everything there is yours now.'\n\nLily had never been allowed in Grandmother's workshop. As a child, she'd pressed her face against the frosted glass window, catching glimpses of shapes and shadows, watching Grandmother's silhouette move with purpose through the space. The door was always locked, and whenever Lily asked what was inside, Grandmother would only say, 'Someday.'\n\nNow someday had arrived, and Lily wasn't sure she wanted it.\n\nShe stood outside the workshop for fifteen minutes, key in hand, making excuses. The weather was too cold. She hadn't slept well. She should wait for her mother. But the real reason, the one she wouldn't admit even to herself, was simpler: opening that door would mean Grandmother was truly gone.\n\nAs long as the workshop remained locked, there was still a secret between them. Still something left to discover. Opening it felt like reading the last page of a book she never wanted to end.\n\nFinally, her frozen fingers found the lock.\n\nThe workshop was smaller than she'd imagined—barely larger than a walk-in closet. But every surface held treasures: jade figurines, half-finished embroidery, delicate paper cuttings, and stacks of notebooks filled with Grandmother's handwriting. On the workbench sat a partially completed sculpture of a crane, its wings outstretched, its head turned as if listening.\n\nLily lifted one of the notebooks and found it wasn't recipes or finances, as she'd assumed. It was drawings—hundreds of them—dated over sixty years. And scattered throughout, dozens of them showed a little girl with two pigtails and a curious expression, peering through a frosted window.\n\nGrandmother had been drawing her. All those years, while Lily had watched from outside, Grandmother had watched right back.\n\nAt the bottom of the notebook, on the very last page, Grandmother had written: 'She has my eyes, and my restlessness. When the time is right, she will understand why some doors must stay closed—until the person on the other side is ready to walk through.'\n\nLily's hands trembled as she set down the notebook. She'd always assumed Grandmother kept her out to protect the workshop. But that wasn't it at all. Grandmother had been protecting something far more fragile: the moment when Lily would be old enough to receive not just the objects, but their meaning.\n\nLily picked up the unfinished crane. Its eyes were still hollow, waiting. She found Grandmother's carving tools right where they'd always been, arranged with the precision of someone who expected to return.\n\nShe didn't know how to carve. But she knew that Grandmother had once stood exactly here, just as uncertain, facing her own first blank piece of jade.\n\nLily lifted a tool and began.\n\nSome inheritances aren't given. They're accepted—when the person is ready.",
