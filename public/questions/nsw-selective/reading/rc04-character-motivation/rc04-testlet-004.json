    "content": "Emma stood in the wings, script clutched against her chest, watching Rachel command the stage. Rachel was everything Emma wasn't: confident, radiant, born to be watched. When Rachel delivered Juliet's lines, the whole auditorium seemed to lean forward.\n\nEmma knew every word. She had to—that was the point of being an understudy. For three months, she'd memorised blocking, practiced inflections in her bedroom mirror, imagined herself in that spotlight. But imagining was all it would ever be. Rachel didn't get sick. Rachel didn't sprain ankles. Rachel was, as Ms Chen liked to say, 'completely reliable.'\n\n'You're not just backup,' Ms Chen had told Emma at the first rehearsal. 'You're insurance. The show can't go on without someone who knows every moment.'\n\nEmma had nodded and smiled and told herself that mattered. But watching from the wings, night after night, she'd started to wonder if she'd taken the role because she was genuinely content to support—or because she was too afraid to audition for something bigger.\n\nTomorrow was the final performance. Then it would be over, and Emma would have learned every line of a play she never performed, and she would tell herself it was valuable experience, and she would almost believe it.\n\n'Emma?' Rachel's voice cut through her thoughts. The lead actress had stepped off-stage during the scene change, breathing heavily. 'Can I ask you something weird?'\n\n'Sure.'\n\n'Do you actually like being understudy? Like, genuinely?'\n\nEmma opened her mouth to say yes—that was the easy answer, the expected one—but something stopped her. Rachel wasn't asking to be polite. Her eyes held a genuine curiosity that demanded honesty.\n\n'I don't know,' Emma admitted. 'I thought I did. But lately I've been wondering if I chose it because it felt... safe.'\n\nRachel nodded slowly. 'That's what I figured.'\n\n'How?'\n\n'Because I've watched you watch me. You know this part better than I do. When I mess up a line, you mouth the right one before I've even corrected myself.' Rachel paused. 'You're not watching to learn. You're watching because you wish it was you.'\n\nEmma felt her face flush. 'I didn't—'\n\n'It's okay,' Rachel said. 'I'm not offended. I just think you should know that next year, they're doing Hamlet. And Ms Chen is going to remember this year—not as the year you were reliable, but as the year you didn't try.'\n\nThe scene change ended. Rachel walked back on stage, and the audience's attention followed her like sunlight.\n\nEmma stayed in the wings, script still pressed against her heart. Tomorrow the show would close. But auditions for Hamlet would open in September.\n\nShe thought about what Rachel had said: 'the year you didn't try.' It stung because it was true. She had chosen safety. She had called it contentment. She had convinced herself that wanting was the same as not being brave enough to reach.\n\nEmma set down the script.\n\nNext year, she decided, the stage wouldn't be something she watched from the wings.\n\nNext year, she would step into the light.",
