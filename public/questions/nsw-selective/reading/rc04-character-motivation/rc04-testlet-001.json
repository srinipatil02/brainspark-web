    "content": "Maya watched from across the cafeteria as the new girl sat alone at the corner table, methodically unwrapping her sandwich as if it required her complete concentration. Three days now, and nobody had talked to her.\n\nIt wasn't that people were being mean, exactly. It was more that everyone already had their groups, their tables, their established orbits. The new girl—Sarah, Maya thought her name was—had arrived in the middle of the school year, which was basically the social equivalent of showing up to a movie twenty minutes late and trying to find a seat in the dark.\n\nMaya knew she should go over. She knew it because she remembered being new once, back in Year 3, standing at the edge of the playground like someone waiting for permission to exist. A girl named Priya had walked over that day and asked if Maya wanted to play handball. Just like that. Seven years later, Priya was still her best friend.\n\nBut Priya wasn't here today—she was home with the flu—and somehow that made everything harder. Without Priya beside her, Maya felt like a different person, a quieter person, someone who noticed things like girls eating alone but didn't necessarily do anything about it.\n\nShe could text Priya for advice. Her phone was right there in her pocket, and Priya always knew what to say. But even as Maya's hand moved toward it, she stopped. She knew exactly what Priya would text back: 'Just go talk to her, dummy. You're making it weird.'\n\nThe thing was, Sarah didn't look sad, exactly. She looked careful. She ate her sandwich in small, deliberate bites, her eyes occasionally scanning the room in a way that seemed almost strategic. Maya recognised that look—it was the look of someone trying very hard to seem fine while cataloguing every detail, waiting to understand the rules before playing the game.\n\nMaya thought about what would happen if she walked over. Sarah might be grateful. Or Sarah might want to be left alone. Or Sarah might be perfectly happy with her sandwich and her strategic observations and might wonder why some random girl was suddenly invading her carefully constructed solitude.\n\nThe lunch period was half over now. Maya had spent fifteen minutes watching and thinking and not doing, which was probably worse than doing nothing at all.\n\nShe stood up before she could talk herself out of it.\n\n'Hey,' Maya said, sliding into the seat across from Sarah. 'I'm Maya. I don't really have a reason to be here, I just noticed you were new and I remembered being new once and it was the worst, so. Yeah. Hi.'\n\nSarah looked at her for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then something in her face shifted—not quite a smile, but something close to it. Something like relief.\n\n'I'm Sarah,' she said. 'And honestly? I've been waiting three days for someone to do exactly this. I was starting to think you all had a rule against talking to new people.'\n\nMaya laughed. 'No rule. We're just really bad at not being awkward.'\n\n'Good to know,' Sarah said. 'I can work with awkward.'",
