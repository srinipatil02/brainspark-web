    "content": "Coach Rivera called a timeout with forty-seven seconds left and the team down by two points. Everyone on the bench knew what was coming: the play would go to Jackson. It always went to Jackson.\n\nJackson was the best player on the team—probably the best player in the league. He could hit three-pointers with defenders hanging off him. He had a crossover that made opponents look like they were standing on ice. Every highlight reel from the season featured Jackson doing something impossible.\n\nBut as the team huddled around Coach Rivera, Marcus noticed something he'd never seen before: Jackson's hands were shaking.\n\n'Jackson takes the final shot,' Coach said, exactly as expected. 'Marcus, you set the screen. Everyone else clears out.'\n\nMarcus nodded, but he kept watching Jackson. The shaking hadn't stopped. Jackson's eyes were fixed on the floor, his jaw tight, his breathing shallow. Marcus had seen this look before—not on Jackson, but on his little brother Daniel before piano recitals. It was the look of someone carrying too much pressure.\n\nThe thing was, Jackson hadn't missed a game-winning shot all season. Four times now, the team had been in exactly this situation, and four times Jackson had delivered. That was the problem, Marcus realised. Jackson wasn't afraid of missing. He was afraid of what missing would mean—that the one thing everyone counted on him for might not be true anymore.\n\n'Hey,' Marcus said quietly, leaning closer to Jackson while Coach continued diagramming the play. 'You know you don't have to make it, right?'\n\nJackson looked up, surprised. 'What?'\n\n'The shot. You don't have to make it. We're still going to be a team tomorrow either way. This isn't... everything.'\n\nJackson stared at him for a long moment. Something in his expression shifted—the tightness in his jaw loosened just slightly.\n\n'Thanks,' Jackson said. It wasn't much, but his hands had stopped shaking.\n\nThe buzzer sounded and the team broke the huddle. Marcus set the screen exactly as planned, and Jackson caught the ball at the three-point line with three seconds left. A defender rushed toward him, arms raised.\n\nJackson pump-faked, and the defender flew past. Then, instead of shooting, Jackson did something no one expected: he passed. The ball found Marcus, alone on the baseline, with no time to think.\n\nMarcus shot. The ball arced through the air, hit the back of the rim, bounced twice, and dropped through the net as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe crowd erupted. Teammates mobbed Marcus, shouting his name. But through the chaos, Marcus found Jackson standing at half-court, smiling.\n\nLater, after the celebration had died down, Marcus caught up with Jackson in the parking lot.\n\n'Why'd you pass?' Marcus asked. 'You had the shot.'\n\nJackson shrugged. 'You told me I didn't have to make it. I figured that meant I didn't have to take it either.' He paused. 'Besides, you were more open than I was. It was the right play.'\n\nMarcus laughed. 'Since when do you make the right play?'\n\n'Since someone reminded me it's not everything,' Jackson said.",
