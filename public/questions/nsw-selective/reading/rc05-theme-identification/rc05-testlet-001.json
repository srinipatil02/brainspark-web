    "content": "Elara had inherited her father's maps but not his certainty. The maps were beautiful—hand-drawn coastlines, mountains rendered in careful crosshatching, forests suggested by clusters of tiny triangles. Every one bore the same confident inscription in the corner: 'Complete and Accurate.'\n\nBut Elara knew they weren't. Not really.\n\nHer father had been the royal cartographer for forty years, mapping the kingdom from the Jade Mountains to the Silver Sea. Kings had trusted his maps. Generals had marched armies based on his contour lines. And for the most part, the maps worked. You could follow them from city to city and arrive where you expected.\n\nIt was the edges that troubled Elara. The places where her father had never actually travelled but had filled in anyway, borrowing from older maps or from merchants' tales or sometimes—she suspected—from nothing but confident imagination. He had drawn a forest in the eastern borderlands that no one she'd spoken to had ever seen. He had placed a river where the actual ground was dry desert.\n\n'A map must be complete,' her father had always said. 'People need to believe they understand the whole picture.'\n\n'But what if the picture is wrong?' she had asked once, as a child.\n\n'Then they'll discover that when they get there,' he had replied. 'But at least they'll have the courage to go.'\n\nNow Elara sat at her father's desk, a blank parchment before her. The Council had commissioned a new map of the northern territories—lands her father had never visited, lands where the old map showed only the word 'Unknown' in elegant script.\n\nShe could do what he had done. She could gather stories, make educated guesses, fill the empty spaces with plausible forests and probable rivers. The Council wanted a complete map, and a complete map was what cartographers provided.\n\nOr she could do something different.\n\nElara picked up her pen and began to draw. She marked the settlements she knew existed, verified by three independent sources. She drew the confirmed roads and rivers. And then, where her knowledge ended, she did something her father had never done.\n\nShe left the space empty.\n\nNot completely empty—she added a note in careful script: 'Territory not yet surveyed. Accuracy unknown.' It looked strange on the parchment, that honest blank space surrounded by detailed geography. It looked incomplete.\n\nBut it was true.\n\nWhen she presented the map to the Council, they frowned at the emptiness. 'Your father never delivered unfinished work,' the Chancellor said.\n\n'It isn't unfinished,' Elara replied. 'It's honest. What we know is drawn. What we don't know is marked as unknown. Anyone who travels there will know they're entering uncertain territory—and they can send back accurate reports to fill in the gaps.'\n\nThe Council debated for hours. Some wanted a different cartographer, one who would provide the comfortable certainty they expected. But in the end, they accepted Elara's map.\n\n'Accurate maps,' she told them as she left, 'are more useful than confident ones.'\n\nShe didn't know if that was true yet. But she believed it.\n\nAnd perhaps, she thought, that belief was her own kind of map—incomplete, uncertain, but pointing in a direction worth travelling.",
