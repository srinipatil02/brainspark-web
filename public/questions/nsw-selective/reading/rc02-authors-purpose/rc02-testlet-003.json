    "content": "Class of 2024, I'm not going to tell you that you're special. You've heard that enough. I'm not going to tell you that you can achieve anything if you just believe in yourself. That's not entirely true, and you're old enough now to handle that fact.\n\nWhat I will tell you is this: the world doesn't owe you success. It doesn't owe you happiness. It doesn't even owe you fairness. This might sound harsh on what should be a day of celebration, but I think you deserve honesty more than comfort.\n\nWhen I graduated, someone told me that my generation would change the world. And you know what? We did change it. Just not always in the ways we intended. We created technologies that connect people across oceans but isolate them from neighbours. We solved problems and created new ones. We meant well but didn't always do well.\n\nYou will inherit our mistakes along with our achievements. That's not fair, but it's real. The question isn't whether you'll face challenges—you will. The question is what kind of people you'll be when you face them.\n\nHere's what I've learned in my forty-seven years that I wish someone had told me at seventeen: failure is not the opposite of success. Failure is the path to success. Every person you admire—every scientist, every artist, every leader—has a closet full of failures they don't talk about in acceptance speeches. The difference between them and the people who gave up isn't talent. It's the willingness to keep failing until something works.\n\nSome of you will become doctors, lawyers, engineers. Some of you will become teachers, artists, parents who stay home with their children. None of these paths is better than another, despite what our culture sometimes suggests. The measure of a life isn't its title or its salary. It's whether you treated people well and left things a little better than you found them.\n\nYou're going to mess up. You're going to hurt people you love, disappoint yourselves, and wonder if you're on the right path. Welcome to being human. The goal isn't perfection—it's recovery. It's apologising when you're wrong. It's getting up after you fall.\n\nAs you leave today, I want you to remember one thing. Not the decorations, not this speech, not even your grades. Remember that you are not the centre of the universe, and that's actually good news. It means the weight of the world isn't on your shoulders alone. It means you're part of something larger than yourself, connected to everyone who came before and everyone who will come after.\n\nThat connection is your strength. Use it well.\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2024. Now go make mistakes worth making.",
