    "content": "Dear Members of the School Board,\n\nI write to you not as a concerned parent, though I am one, nor as a taxpayer, though I am that too. I write as someone who remembers what it was like to be twelve years old and terrified of lunchtime.\n\nYour proposed cuts to the school counselling program have been framed as a necessary budget measure. Numbers have been cited, spreadsheets presented, and difficult decisions invoked. But I wonder: have you calculated the cost of what cannot be measured?\n\nWhen I was in Year 7, Mrs Patterson saved my life. Not dramatically—there was no rushing to hospital, no headline-worthy intervention. She simply noticed. She noticed that I sat alone. She noticed that my grades had slipped. She noticed the shadows under my eyes. And one ordinary Tuesday, she asked if I wanted to talk.\n\nThat conversation didn't solve everything. But it cracked open a door I had nailed shut. It showed me that someone saw me when I felt invisible. In the twenty-three years since, I have become a doctor. I have helped hundreds of patients through their darkest moments. None of that would exist if Mrs Patterson hadn't been there on that ordinary Tuesday.\n\nYou might argue that my story is exceptional. Perhaps it is. But consider this: for every student whose story becomes visible—through achievement or, tragically, through crisis—there are dozens whose stories remain hidden. The quiet ones. The ones who have learned to seem fine. The ones whose pain only surfaces years later, or never at all.\n\nCounsellors don't just respond to crises. They prevent them. They build trust over months and years. They create spaces where students can be honest about struggles they hide from everyone else. This work cannot be replicated by overburdened teachers, however caring. It cannot be replaced by apps or hotlines, however well-intentioned.\n\nThe budget shortfall is real. I don't deny this. But I ask you to consider what other line items might absorb cuts before we sacrifice the people who stand between struggling students and despair. New sporting equipment can wait. Upgraded technology can wait. The twelve-year-old sitting alone at lunch cannot.\n\nI urge you to visit the counselling office before making your decision. Speak to the students who use it. Ask them what it means to have someone who listens. Then look at your spreadsheets again and tell me the numbers still make sense.\n\nThe life you save may never know you saved it. That's the nature of prevention—its successes are invisible. But they are no less real for being unseen.\n\nSincerely,\nDr Sarah Chen",
