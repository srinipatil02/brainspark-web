    "content": "Maya stared at the science fair display board across the hall—Priya's board—with its perfect lettering and professionally printed photographs. Three years in a row, Priya had won first place. Three years in a row, Maya had watched from the crowd as Priya collected her ribbon and trophy, smiling that modest smile that somehow made her victories feel even more inevitable.\n\nThis year was supposed to be different. Maya had spent six months on her project about water purification using locally sourced materials. She had conducted over forty experiments, documenting each failure and breakthrough in her worn notebook. Her grandmother had helped her test the final design in their village during the summer holidays, where clean water was not something people took for granted.\n\nBut looking at Priya's display now—'Artificial Intelligence in Medical Diagnosis'—Maya felt the familiar weight of doubt pressing against her chest. Priya's project gleamed with technology and sophistication. The judges would be impressed by those neural network diagrams, those sleek interfaces. What chance did bamboo filters and ceramic pots stand against machine learning algorithms?\n\n'Your project is beautiful,' said a voice beside her.\n\nMaya turned to find Mrs Chen, her science teacher, studying Priya's board with an expression Maya couldn't quite read.\n\n'Priya's project,' Maya clarified. 'Yes, it's very... advanced.'\n\n'I wasn't talking about Priya's project.' Mrs Chen's eyes crinkled slightly. 'I was talking about yours. I watched you present it to the junior students last week. You didn't just explain the science—you told them about your grandmother's village, about the children who get sick from contaminated water, about why this matters.'\n\nMaya shifted uncomfortably. 'The judges don't give points for stories.'\n\n'Don't they?' Mrs Chen turned to face her directly. 'Maya, do you know what makes a scientist? It isn't the fanciest equipment or the most complicated algorithms. It's asking the right questions about real problems. It's caring enough to keep trying when experiments fail. Forty-three times, wasn't it?'\n\n'Forty-six,' Maya admitted.\n\n'Forty-six.' Mrs Chen nodded slowly. 'Priya's project is impressive. But I wonder—did she lose sleep over it? Did she dream about it? Did she feel her heart sink with every failed attempt and soar with every small success?'\n\nMaya didn't answer, but she thought about all those nights bent over test results, about the moment when murky water finally emerged clear, about the photograph her grandmother had sent of village children drinking safely for the first time.\n\nThe judges were beginning their rounds. Maya watched them pause at Priya's display, nodding appreciatively at the technical complexity. Then they moved to Maya's corner, where bamboo and clay sat alongside handwritten data tables and a laminated photo of her grandmother smiling beside a working water filter.\n\nOne judge picked up Maya's worn notebook, flipping through pages of crossed-out hypotheses and revised calculations. She studied it for a long moment, then looked at Maya with something that might have been recognition.\n\n'Tell me,' the judge said, 'why water purification?'\n\nMaya took a breath. This wasn't a question about methodology or data analysis. This was the question that mattered.\n\n'Because my grandmother,' Maya began, 'shouldn't have to boil water for twenty minutes just to make tea.'",
