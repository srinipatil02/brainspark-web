    "content": "The house smelled of cardboard boxes and dust, the particular scent of endings. Mia ran her fingers along the kitchen counter one last time, feeling the familiar chip near the stove where she'd dropped a pan when she was seven. Her mother had been furious, but even then, Mia had secretly liked having a mark on something, proof that she'd been there.\n\nOutside, the moving truck waited with the patience of something that knew it would win. Her father was already loading boxes, his movements mechanical, his face carefully arranged into an expression that said nothing was wrong, everything was fine, this was just another ordinary day.\n\nBut it wasn't ordinary. Twelve years of mornings at this kitchen table. Twelve years of running through that back door. Twelve years of her handprints on the glass, her secrets whispered to the walls, her tears soaked into the carpet of her bedroom.\n\nThe new house was bigger. Her parents kept reminding her of this, as if square footage could compensate for the willow tree in the backyard where she'd read a thousand books, or the creek behind the fence where tadpoles became frogs every spring, or the way the afternoon light came through her window at exactly the right angle to make rainbow patterns on her wall.\n\n'Almost ready?' Her mother appeared in the doorway, her voice bright in that particular way that meant she was trying too hard. Behind her cheerfulness, Mia could see exhaustion, and something else—a flicker of the same grief Mia was drowning in, carefully hidden behind a grown-up mask.\n\n'I just need a minute.'\n\nHer mother nodded, understanding passing between them without words. For a moment, the mask slipped, and Mia saw her own sadness reflected back. Then her mother turned away, returning to the business of leaving.\n\nMia walked through each room one final time. The living room where she'd built blanket forts. The bathroom where she'd cried the night Sarah stopped being her friend. The hallway where she'd measured her height each birthday, pencil marks climbing the doorframe like a ladder through time.\n\nThey'd painted over those marks last week. Preparation for the next family, the realtor had said. As if twelve years could be erased with a coat of white paint.\n\nShe paused at the front door, hand on the knob, and looked back at the empty house. It didn't look like home anymore—just rooms, just walls, just a shell of what had been.\n\n'Goodbye,' she whispered, the word catching in her throat.\n\nThe house, of course, said nothing back. Houses never do. But Mia could have sworn she felt something—a warmth, a sigh, an acknowledgment of all the living that had happened within these walls.\n\nShe stepped outside and didn't look back again.",
