    "content": "They closed my favourite restaurant last month. I found out through a sign on the window—handwritten, apologetic, thanking customers for twenty-three years of support. Just like that, a place I'd been going since I was five years old became past tense.\n\nIt wasn't fancy. Food critics would have called it unremarkable: sticky vinyl booths, laminated menus with faded photographs, the same dishes decade after decade. The lighting was too bright, the napkins were paper, and the background music was whatever radio station the cook preferred that day.\n\nBut my family had celebrated every birthday there since I could remember. My grandmother always ordered the same thing—chicken parmigiana with extra sauce—and always pronounced it wrong, and my grandfather always corrected her, and she always ignored him. This was their ritual, as sacred as any prayer.\n\nThe food wasn't what I'll miss. I'll miss the way the owner, Maria, remembered our names. The way she'd bring out a free dessert when she heard someone was having a hard week. The way she'd scold us—gently, lovingly—if we hadn't visited in too long. 'You forget about Maria,' she'd say, hand over her heart, performing hurt so convincingly that my mother would apologise every time.\n\nI drove past the building yesterday. The sign is gone now. The windows are papered over, hiding whatever transformation is happening inside. A new restaurant will open eventually—something sleeker, probably, with small portions and large prices. It will have better reviews and trendier food and absolutely nothing that matters to me.\n\nMaybe I'm being sentimental. Restaurants close all the time; it's the nature of the business. New places rise to take their old ones' spots, and life continues. The world doesn't owe me a preserved childhood, frozen in time like a museum exhibit.\n\nBut sentiment isn't always foolishness. Sometimes it's just love wearing different clothes. I loved that restaurant not for what it was but for what it held: my grandmother's voice, my grandfather's gentle corrections, Maria's theatrical scolding, the accumulated weight of ordinary moments that somehow became irreplaceable.\n\nSo yes, I'm mourning a restaurant. It sounds absurd when I say it that way. But I think Maria would understand. She knew that her place was never really about the food—it was about the belonging. And now that belonging has lost its address.\n\nSomewhere in the city, other families are making their own rituals in their own unremarkable restaurants. I hope they have twenty-three years. I hope they have more.",
