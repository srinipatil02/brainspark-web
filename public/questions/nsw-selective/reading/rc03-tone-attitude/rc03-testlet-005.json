    "content": "My science fair project was, according to my mother, 'ambitious.' According to my father, it was 'certainly something.' According to my little sister, who has no filter whatsoever, it was 'the ugliest volcano she'd ever seen.' She wasn't wrong.\n\nThe thing about building a model volcano is that everyone assumes it's easy. Every year, approximately fourteen thousand students build volcanoes for science fairs, and approximately fourteen thousand of them work perfectly. Mine, however, had decided to be an individual.\n\nI'd followed the instructions precisely. Well, mostly precisely. The recipe called for baking soda and vinegar, which I had. It also called for dish soap, which I substituted with shampoo because the bottle was closer. It called for red food colouring, which I replaced with purple because red seemed too obvious. These small creative choices, I was certain, would make my volcano stand out.\n\nIt stood out, all right.\n\nOn the morning of the science fair, I carried my masterpiece into the gymnasium with the careful reverence of someone transporting a sleeping baby—if sleeping babies occasionally leaked purple foam from their nostrils. The gymnasium had been transformed into a temple of scientific achievement. There were solar system models with planets that actually rotated. There were electrical circuits that lit up like Christmas trees. There was a girl named Priya whose robot could sort coloured blocks faster than I could say 'I should have built a robot.'\n\nAnd then there was my volcano, sitting on its cardboard base like a melting dessert, already beginning to ooze purple rivulets down its lumpy brown sides.\n\nThe judges arrived at my table with their clipboards and their encouraging smiles—the kind of smiles adults wear when they're trying very hard not to laugh. 'And what do we have here?' asked the head judge, a man whose eyebrows seemed to be having a private conversation with each other.\n\n'It's a volcano,' I said, because sometimes stating the obvious is all you've got.\n\n'Wonderful!' he said, in the same tone you'd use to compliment a toddler's drawing. 'And can you tell us about the scientific principle you're demonstrating?'\n\nI pressed the hidden button. The volcano made a sound like a disappointed sigh, then proceeded to erupt with all the enthusiasm of a sneeze. Purple foam dribbled down the sides with the urgency of cold honey.\n\n'Chemical reactions,' I said weakly. 'Acid and base.'\n\nThe judge nodded, wrote something on his clipboard that was definitely not 'first place,' and moved on to Priya's robot, which had started sorting blocks to what I swear was applause from the other judges.\n\nI didn't win, obviously. I didn't even place. But as I carried my defeated volcano back to the car, my father put his arm around my shoulder. 'You know what I love about this?' he said.\n\n'What?'\n\n'Next year, you'll have a really great story about why you're not building a volcano.'\n\nHe wasn't wrong either.",
