# Scaffolded Learning Sequences

Progressive difficulty building student confidence through structured support.

## Core Principles

1. **Start where students are** - Build on existing knowledge
2. **Small steps** - One new element at a time
3. **Gradual release** - Remove scaffolds as competence grows
4. **Success builds confidence** - Early wins motivate continued effort
5. **Explicit connections** - Link new learning to established concepts

## Scaffolding Strategies

### Conceptual Scaffolding
- Pre-teach vocabulary
- Activate prior knowledge
- Use analogies and comparisons
- Provide worked examples

### Procedural Scaffolding
- Step-by-step guidance
- Checklists and templates
- Partial solutions to complete
- Think-aloud demonstrations

### Strategic Scaffolding
- Problem-solving frameworks
- Question prompts
- Metacognitive cues
- Self-monitoring tools

## Question Difficulty Levels

### Level 1: Recognition (Foundation)
- Single concept
- Direct recall
- Familiar context
- Explicit language
- Example: "Which state of matter has particles in fixed positions?"

### Level 2: Comprehension (Foundation/Application)
- Single concept applied
- Rephrased scenarios
- Near transfer
- Example: "Why can't you compress a solid?"

### Level 3: Application (Application/Connection)
- Combine 2 concepts
- Novel context
- Requires reasoning
- Example: "Using the particle model, explain why ice floats"

### Level 4: Analysis (Connection/Mastery)
- Connect 3+ concepts
- Compare and contrast
- Identify relationships
- Example: "Compare particle behaviour across all three states as temperature increases"

### Level 5: Synthesis (Mastery)
- Full integration
- Novel problems
- Create or predict
- Example: "Design an experiment to demonstrate that gases have mass"

## Scaffolding Within Questions

### Scaffolded Question Format
```
Context: [Familiar scenario]

Part A: [Recognition/recall - build confidence]
Part B: [Apply concept - extend thinking]
Part C: [Connect concepts - challenge]
```

### Example: States of Matter Scaffolded Question
```
A glass of ice water sits on a table on a warm day.

Part A: Name the three states of matter present in this scene.
(Ice = solid, Water = liquid, Air around glass = gas)

Part B: Describe how the particles are arranged in the ice
compared to the water.

Part C: Over time, water droplets appear on the outside of
the glass. Explain where this water came from using
your knowledge of particle behaviour.
```

## Hint Scaffolding (Within Questions)

### Three-Level Hint System

**Level 1: Activation** (Doesn't reveal answer)
- Activates prior knowledge
- Directs attention to relevant concept
- "What do you already know about...?"
- "Think back to what you learned about..."

**Level 2: Focus** (Narrows scope)
- Points to specific aspect
- Provides partial framework
- "Focus on how [concept] relates to..."
- "Consider the difference between..."

**Level 3: Guidance** (Guides to answer)
- Provides reasoning scaffold
- Near-complete framework
- "The key is understanding that [principle]..."
- "Connect [A] to [B] using what you know about [C]"

### Example Hint Progression

**Question**: Why does sweating cool you down?

**Level 1**: "Think about what happens to the sweat on your skin"
(Activates: evaporation concept)

**Level 2**: "When liquid water becomes water vapour, it needs energy.
Where does this energy come from?"
(Focuses: energy transfer in evaporation)

**Level 3**: "Evaporation requires energy. The heat from your body
provides this energy. What happens to your body when
it loses heat energy?"
(Guides: heat loss = cooling)

## Vocabulary Scaffolding

### Tier System for Year 8

**Tier 1: Everyday Words** (Use freely)
- matter, solid, liquid, gas
- hot, cold, temperature
- change, move, space
- energy, heat

**Tier 2: Academic Words** (Define first use)
- particle, molecule
- evaporate, condense, melt, freeze
- expand, contract
- conduct, transfer

**Tier 3: Domain-Specific** (Heavy scaffold)

   "Particles (tiny pieces that make up all matter)..."

2. Second use: Brief reminder
   "The particles in..."

3. Third use onward: Use without definition
   "Particles..."
```
