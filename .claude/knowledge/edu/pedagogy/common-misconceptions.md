# Common Student Misconceptions

Documented misconceptions by subject and topic with correction strategies.

## Why Target Misconceptions?

1. **Persistent** - Misconceptions resist change even after instruction
2. **Systematic** - Often based on intuitive reasoning that "makes sense"
3. **Widespread** - Many students share the same misconceptions
4. **Teachable moments** - Confronting misconceptions deepens understanding

## Misconception Question Formats

### Surface the Misconception
```
A student says: "[misconception statement]"
Is this correct? Explain why or why not.
```

### Predict with Misconception
```
Based on the idea that [misconception], what would you predict?
Now test this prediction: [provide data/scenario]
What does this tell you?
```

### Compare Explanations
```
Two students are discussing [topic]:
- Student A says: "[correct view]"
- Student B says: "[misconception]"
Who is correct and why?
```

## SCIENCE Misconceptions

### States of Matter (Year 8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Particles stop moving in solids" | Particles vibrate in fixed positions | Solids don't visibly move |
| "Particles get bigger when heated" | Spacing increases, particles same size | Things "expand" when heated |
| "Cold makes particles stop" | Particles slow but never stop (above 0K) | Cold = absence of movement |
| "Gas has no mass/weight" | All matter has mass | Can't feel air's weight |
| "Water disappears when it evaporates" | Changes to invisible water vapour | Can't see where it goes |
| "Melting and dissolving are same" | Melting = state change; dissolving = mixing | Both make things "disappear" |

### Chemical Reactions (Year 8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Mass is lost when burning" | Products (gases) escape; mass conserved | Ash weighs less than wood |
| "Atoms change during reactions" | Atoms rearrange, never change | "Chemical change" language |
| "Rust comes from inside metal" | Oxygen from air combines with metal | Rust appears on metal |
| "Reactions always produce heat" | Some are endothermic (absorb heat) | Most familiar reactions exothermic |

### Energy (Year 8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Energy is used up" | Energy transforms, never destroyed | "Using" energy language |
| "Cold is transferred like heat" | Cold is absence of heat; heat transfers | "Cold air coming in" feeling |
| "Heat and temperature are same" | Heat = energy transfer; temp = measure | Common language conflation |
| "Metals are cold" | Metals conduct heat away faster | Feel cold to touch |

### Biology/Cells (Year 8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Cells are flat like pictures" | Cells are 3D structures | Textbook diagrams are 2D |
| "Plants get food from soil" | Plants make food via photosynthesis | We "feed" plants with fertilizer |
| "Respiration is breathing" | Respiration = cellular energy release | Common language confusion |

## MATHEMATICS Misconceptions

### Fractions (Years 6-8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Larger denominator = larger fraction" | Larger denominator = smaller pieces | Bigger numbers = bigger values |
| "$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{5}$" | Need common denominator = $\frac{5}{6}$ | Add tops, add bottoms |
| "Multiply fractions = bigger" | $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$ (smaller) | Multiplication = increase |
| "Can't have fraction > 1" | Improper fractions exist (e.g., $\frac{5}{3}$) | Fractions = "part of whole" |
| "0.5 is less than 0.25" | 0.5 > 0.25 | More digits = bigger number |

### Decimals (Years 6-8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "0.3 × 10 = 0.30" | 0.3 × 10 = 3 | Adding zero like whole numbers |
| "Longer decimal = larger" | 0.5 > 0.125 | More digits = bigger |
| "0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3 exactly" | In computing, may have floating point issues | Seems obvious |

### Percentages (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "50% of 20 = 50 + 20" | 50% of 20 = 10 | Misunderstanding "of" |
| "Can't have % > 100" | 200% = double the original | % = "out of 100" |
| "% increase then decrease returns to original" | 20% up then 20% down ≠ original | Percentages aren't additive |

### Algebra (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Letters are abbreviations" | Variables represent unknown numbers | "a = apples" teaching |
| "$5x$ means $5 + x$" | $5x$ means $5 \times x$ | Missing operation sign |
| "= means 'the answer is'" | = means both sides are equal | Calculator use |
| "$x^2$ means $x \times 2$" | $x^2$ means $x \times x$ | Notation confusion |
| "$(x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4$" | $(x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$ | Missing middle term |

### Negative Numbers (Years 7-8)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "$-3$ is larger than $-1$" | $-1 > -3$ | 3 is bigger than 1 |
| "$-3 - 5 = -2$" | $-3 - 5 = -8$ | Subtraction always makes smaller |
| "$-2 \times -3 = -6$" | $-2 \times -3 = +6$ | Negative × negative rule |

### Geometry (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "All angles in triangle = 60°" | Angles sum to 180°, not necessarily equal | Equilateral triangle focus |
| "Bigger shape = bigger angles" | Angle size independent of side length | Visual scaling |
| "Perimeter and area related" | Same perimeter can have different areas | Both measure "size" |
| "Diagonal of square = side" | Diagonal = side × $\sqrt{2}$ | Looks similar length |

### Ratios and Proportion (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Ratio 2:3 means 2 and 3" | Ratio 2:3 in 10 items = 4 and 6 | Not understanding parts |
| "Add same to both parts" | Must multiply to maintain ratio | Additive thinking |

## ENGLISH Misconceptions

### Grammar (Years 6-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Never start sentence with 'And'" | Starting with 'And' is acceptable in modern usage | Outdated rule taught |
| "Never split infinitives" | "To boldly go" is acceptable | Outdated prescriptive rule |
| "'Their' for singular is wrong" | Singular 'they/their' is accepted | Traditional grammar taught |
| "Passive voice is always bad" | Passive has valid uses (science, emphasis) | Over-simplified writing rules |

### Punctuation (Years 6-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Comma wherever you pause" | Commas have grammatical rules | Reading aloud strategy |
| "Semicolon = strong comma" | Semicolon joins independent clauses | Misunderstanding function |
| "Apostrophe in plurals" | "Apple's" for apples is wrong | Overgeneralization |
| "It's = possessive" | "Its" = possessive, "It's" = it is | Confusing patterns |

### Reading Comprehension (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Author's message is obvious" | Meaning often implied, requires inference | Surface reading |
| "Characters are good or bad" | Characters are complex, nuanced | Simplified narratives |
| "Facts in text are true" | Authors have bias, perspective | Trust in written word |

### Writing (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Longer words are better" | Clear, precise words are better | Trying to sound smart |
| "More adjectives = better description" | Specific nouns/verbs often stronger | "Use more descriptive words" feedback |
| "First draft should be perfect" | Writing is a process of revision | Perfectionism |
| "Thesis at the end of intro" | Thesis placement can vary by style | Formula teaching |

### Persuasive Writing (Years 7-9)

| Misconception | Reality | Why Students Think This |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "Just state your opinion strongly" | Need evidence and reasoning | Opinion vs argument |
| "Ignore counterarguments" | Addressing counterarguments strengthens | Fear of weakening position |
| "Emotional appeal is enough" | Need logos, ethos, and pathos | Emotional effectiveness |
