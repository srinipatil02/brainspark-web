# Socratic Inquiry Question Patterns

Questions that prompt deep thinking by asking "why" and "how" rather than "what" — applicable across all subjects.

## Core Principles

1. **Questions, not answers** - Lead students to discover answers themselves
2. **Challenge assumptions** - Surface implicit beliefs for examination
3. **Probe reasoning** - Ask for evidence and justification
4. **Explore alternatives** - Consider other viewpoints and possibilities
5. **Examine consequences** - Think through implications

## Universal Question Stems by Purpose

### Clarification Questions
- "What do you mean when you say...?"
- "Can you explain that in a different way?"
- "What would be an example of...?"
- "How does this relate to...?"

### Probing Assumptions
- "What are you assuming when you say...?"
- "Why do you think that is true?"
- "What would happen if that assumption were wrong?"
- "Is this always the case, or are there exceptions?"

### Probing Reasons and Evidence
- "What evidence supports your answer?"
- "How do you know this?"
- "What would change your mind?"
- "Can you give me a reason for thinking that?"

### Exploring Viewpoints
- "What would someone who disagrees say?"
- "How might [expert/character] approach this differently?"
- "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this view?"
- "Is there another way to look at this?"

### Probing Implications
- "What would be the consequences of...?"
- "If that is true, what else must be true?"
- "How does this affect...?"
- "What follows from this conclusion?"

### Meta-Questions
- "Why is this question important?"
- "What makes this difficult to understand?"
- "How could we find out if this is true?"
- "What would we need to know to answer this?"

## SCIENCE Socratic Questions

### States of Matter
- "Why do you think particles behave differently in solids versus liquids?"
- "What evidence could we collect to test whether particles move in solids?"
- "If particles always move, why doesn't a solid flow like a liquid?"
- "What would happen to the particles if we removed all the heat?"

### Chemical Reactions
- "How do you know a chemical reaction has occurred?"
- "If mass is conserved, where did the 'missing' mass go when we burned the paper?"
- "Why might temperature affect how fast a reaction happens?"

### Energy
- "If energy cannot be created or destroyed, where does the energy 'go' when something slows down?"
- "Why do you think some materials feel colder than others at the same temperature?"
- "What assumptions are we making when we say energy is 'used up'?"

### Biology
- "Why do you think all living things are made of cells?"
- "What would happen to an organism if its cells stopped dividing?"
- "How might we test whether plants need light to make food?"

## MATHEMATICS Socratic Questions

### Fractions and Decimals
- "Why does multiplying by a fraction less than 1 make a number smaller?"
- "What pattern do you notice when dividing by fractions?"
- "How could you prove that your method works for any fraction?"
- "Why can we represent the same value as both $\frac{1}{2}$ and $0.5$?"

### Algebra
- "What does the variable actually represent in this problem?"
- "How do you know both sides of the equation are equal?"
- "Why does the order of operations matter?"
- "What would happen if we changed [this value]?"
- "Can you think of a case where this formula wouldn't work?"

### Geometry
- "How do you know these triangles are similar?"
- "Why does the angle sum of a triangle always equal 180°?"
- "What stays the same and what changes when we scale a shape?"
- "How could you prove that this is always true?"

### Statistics and Probability
- "What assumptions are hidden in this average?"
- "How might this sample be biased?"
- "Why doesn't past performance guarantee future results?"
- "What would make this data more or less reliable?"

### Problem Solving
- "What information do you have, and what do you need?"
- "Is there another method that would also work?"
- "How could you check if your answer makes sense?"
- "What if we changed [one condition]? How would that affect the answer?"

## Target Feelings for Socratic Questions

All subjects:
- "I need to think about this more deeply"
- "I didn't consider that before"
- "Now I understand WHY, not just WHAT"
- "I can reason through this myself"
- "There's more complexity here than I first thought"

## Hint Progression for Socratic Questions

### Level 1 Hint (Reframe)
Reframe the question, prompt a different angle
- "Think about what you already know about [related concept]"
- "Consider what would happen if [scenario]"
- "What does [key term] really mean?"

### Level 2 Hint (Narrow)
Narrow the scope, provide scaffolding
- "Focus on just [one aspect] first"
- "What does [key term] tell you about this?"
- "Compare this to [familiar situation]"

### Level 3 Hint (Guide)
Guide toward reasoning path
- "The connection between [A] and [B] is key here"
- "Apply what you know about [concept] to this situation"
- "Consider the [cause/effect/relationship]"
