# Phenomenon-Based Learning Examples

Real-world observations and authentic contexts that drive curiosity across all subjects.

## Core Principles

1. **Start with wonder** - Begin with something observable and surprising
2. **Ask "Why does this happen?"** - Anchor learning to real experience
3. **Connect to daily life** - Use familiar contexts for new concepts
4. **Build explanatory models** - Students construct understanding
5. **Predict and test** - Apply understanding to new situations

## Phenomenon Categories

### Everyday Observations
Observable in daily life, require explanation

### Counterintuitive Events
Challenge expectations, create cognitive dissonance

### Authentic Contexts
Real-world scenarios where skills apply

### Cultural and Social
Human behaviour and social patterns

This happens because: [leave for student to explain]
```

### Driving Question Formats

**Science:**
- "What causes [phenomenon] to happen?"
- "Using [model/theory], explain why..."
- "What would happen if [change variable]?"

**Mathematics:**
- "What pattern do you notice?"
- "Is this always true? Why or why not?"
- "How could you represent this mathematically?"

**English:**
