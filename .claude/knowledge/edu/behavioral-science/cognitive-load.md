# Cognitive Load Theory for Question Design

Principles for managing working memory load in educational content.

## Core Concepts

### Working Memory Limitations
- Humans can hold ~4 items in working memory at once
- New information competes for limited capacity
- Overload leads to frustration and learning failure
- Proper load management enables deep processing

### Three Types of Cognitive Load

| Type | Description | Management Strategy |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Complexity inherent to the content | Match to learner level, chunk concepts |
| **Extraneous** | Load from poor design/presentation | Minimize distractions, clear layout |
| **Germane** | Load from schema construction | Encourage connections, reflection |

**Goal**: Minimize extraneous, manage intrinsic, maximize germane

## Design Principles

### 1. Coherence Principle
**Remove** extraneous material that doesn't support learning goals

**Do**:
- Use clear, concise language
- Include only relevant information
- Simple, clean question layouts

**Don't**:
- Add decorative graphics
- Include tangential facts
- Use complex sentence structures unnecessarily

### 2. Signaling Principle
**Highlight** essential information to guide attention

**Do**:
- Bold key terms on first use
- Use clear headings and structure
- Emphasize critical relationships

**Don't**:
- Highlight everything (nothing stands out)
- Bury important info in dense paragraphs

### 3. Redundancy Principle
**Avoid** presenting same information in multiple forms

**Do**:
- Diagram OR text description (not both saying same thing)
- Audio OR text (not simultaneous identical content)

**Don't**:
- Read aloud text that's on screen
- Caption images with text that repeats image content

### 4. Spatial Contiguity
**Place** related elements close together

**Do**:
- Labels next to diagram parts
- Explanation near relevant image
- Hints appear near question

**Don't**:
- Force scrolling between question and answer options
- Separate diagrams from referring text

### 5. Temporal Contiguity
**Present** related elements simultaneously

**Do**:
- Animation with synchronized narration
- Image appears when referenced

**Don't**:
- Show image on one page, reference on next
- Delayed appearance of supporting content

### 6. Segmenting Principle
**Break** complex content into learner-paced segments

**Do**:
- One concept per question (Phase 1-2)
- Progressive revelation of complexity
- Natural pause points

**Don't**:
- Dump all information at once
- Combine multiple new concepts in single question

### 7. Pre-training Principle
**Introduce** names and characteristics before processes

**Do**:
- Teach vocabulary before application
- Name parts before explaining interactions
- Build foundation before extension

**Don't**:
- Assume prior knowledge without checking
- Jump to complex processes before basics

### 8. Modality Principle
**Use** multiple channels (visual + auditory) when appropriate

**Do**:
- Diagrams with verbal explanation
- Animation with audio narration
- Visual + verbal complements

**Note**: Less relevant for text-based questions, more for multimedia

## Application to Question Design

### Question Complexity Analysis

**Low Cognitive Load** (Phase 1)
```
Elements: 1 concept, 1 step, familiar context
Example: "Name the three states of matter"
Load: Intrinsic only, single retrieval
```

**Moderate Cognitive Load** (Phase 2)
```
Elements: 1-2 concepts, 2-3 steps, applied context
Example: "Explain why ice floats using particle model"
Load: Requires connection of 2 concepts
```

**High Cognitive Load** (Phase 3-4)
```
Elements: 3+ concepts, multiple steps, novel context
Example: "Compare and contrast particle behaviour..."
Load: Multiple concepts, synthesis required
```

### Managing Load in Questions

**When Load is High (Complex Questions)**:
1. Provide scaffolding (structured hints)
2. Break into parts (A, B, C)
3. Use familiar contexts
4. Include worked examples
5. Reference prior learning

**When Students are Novices**:
1. Keep questions simpler
2. Provide more scaffolding
3. Use concrete examples
4. Limit new vocabulary
5. Build confidence first

## Load Indicators for Question Validators

### Green Flags (Appropriate Load)
- Single concept focus
- Clear, direct language
- Familiar scenario
- Builds on established knowledge
- One cognitive demand at a time

### Yellow Flags (Review Needed)
- Two concepts combined
- New vocabulary introduced
- Unfamiliar context
- Multiple steps required
- Abstract relationships

### Red Flags (Likely Overload)
- Three+ new concepts
- Novel context + novel content
- Dense technical language
- Many elements to track
- No scaffolding provided

## Worked Example Effect

For novices, studying worked examples > problem solving

### Implementation in Questions
- Phase 1: Provide more worked examples
- Phase 2: Partial examples (fill in gaps)
- Phase 3: Fewer examples, more problems
- Phase 4: Full problem solving

### Fading Strategy
```
Q1-5:   Full worked example, then similar problem
Q6-10:  Partial example, complete the solution
Q11-15: Problem with hints available
Q16-20: Problem with minimal scaffolding
```

## Expertise Reversal Effect

**Warning**: What helps novices can hinder experts

As students gain expertise:
- Redundant information becomes distracting
- Scaffolding becomes patronizing
- Need more challenge, less support

### Application
- Phase 1: Heavy scaffolding (novice to concept)
- Phase 2: Moderate scaffolding
- Phase 3: Light scaffolding
- Phase 4: Minimal scaffolding (expertise developing)

## Cognitive Load Checklist

For each question, verify:
- [ ] Number of new concepts ≤ phase-appropriate limit
- [ ] Language complexity matches year level
- [ ] Required prior knowledge explicitly established
- [ ] Scaffolding available and progressive
- [ ] Visual elements support (not distract from) learning
- [ ] No redundant information
- [ ] Related elements positioned together
- [ ] Difficulty matches phase in learning arc
