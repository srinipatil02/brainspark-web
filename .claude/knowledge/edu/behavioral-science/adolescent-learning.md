# Adolescent Learning Psychology

Understanding how 12-15 year olds learn for effective question design.

## Adolescent Brain Development

### Key Developmental Facts

| Aspect | Implication for Learning |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Prefrontal cortex developing** | Executive function improving but not mature |
| **Reward system heightened** | More responsive to immediate feedback |
| **Social brain active** | Peer opinions matter; social learning effective |
| **Sleep patterns shift** | May affect morning alertness |
| **Risk-taking increased** | More willing to try, also more impulsive |

### Cognitive Capabilities (Ages 12-15)

**Can Do**:
- Abstract thinking emerging
- Hypothetical reasoning
- Multiple perspectives
- Systematic problem-solving
- Metacognition (thinking about thinking)

**Still Developing**:
- Long-term planning
- Impulse control
- Emotional regulation under stress
- Sustained attention
- Consistent self-monitoring

## Learning Characteristics

### Attention

**Attention Span**: ~10-15 minutes focused attention
- Break content into segments
- Vary question types
- Use active engagement

**Distractibility**: High (especially digital)
- Clear, focused questions
- Minimize extraneous elements
- Mobile-friendly design

**Multi-tasking**: Perceived ability > actual ability
- One question/task at a time
- Clear completion signals

### Memory

**Working Memory**: ~4 items, improving
- Limit new concepts per question
- Use chunking strategies
- Provide scaffolding

**Long-term Memory**: Requires meaning
- Connect to prior knowledge
- Use elaborative strategies
- Spaced repetition built into arc

### Reasoning

**Formal Operations**: Emerging
- Can handle abstract concepts with scaffolding
- Hypothetical "what if" questions accessible
- Logic improving but needs practice

**Scientific Reasoning**: Developing
- Can identify variables with support
- Systematic approach improving
- Evidence-based thinking teachable

## Social Influences

### Peer Relationships

**Priority**: Peer acceptance is paramount

**Design Implications**:
- "A student says..." formats work well
- Explain to others scenarios
- Avoid embarrassment potential
- Privacy in progress/scores

### Identity Development

**Questions Adolescents Ask**:
- Who am I?
- Where do I fit?
- What am I good at?

**Design Implications**:
- Support competence development
- Connect learning to identity
- Allow multiple approaches
- Celebrate improvement over innate ability

### Authority and Autonomy

**Seeking**: Independence, voice, choice
**Resisting**: Being told what to think

**Design Implications**:
- Inquiry over instruction
- Discovery over telling
- Optional hints (learner control)
- Questions that value student thinking

## Emotional Considerations

### Emotional Intensity

Adolescent emotions are:
- More intense than adults experience
- More variable day-to-day
- Tied to social experiences
- Affecting learning capacity

**Design Implications**:
- Recovery paths from frustration
- Success opportunities to rebuild confidence
- Non-threatening question formats
- Growth mindset language

### Fear of Failure

**Common Fears**:
- Looking stupid to peers
- Disappointing adults
- Not being "smart enough"
- Public failure

**Design Implications**:
- Private learning environment
- Mistakes as learning opportunities
- Scaffolded hints prevent total failure
- Progress over perfection

### Self-Efficacy

**Adolescent Pattern**: Often lower self-efficacy than actual ability

**Building Self-Efficacy**:
1. Mastery experiences (success!)
2. Vicarious experiences (others succeeded)
3. Verbal persuasion (you can do this)
4. Physiological states (calm = capable)

## Language and Communication

### Vocabulary Considerations (Year 8)

**Reading Level**: ~Grade 6-8 text complexity
**Vocabulary**: Building academic vocabulary

**Guidelines**:
- Define Tier 2 academic words
- Limit Tier 3 domain-specific without scaffold
- Use concrete before abstract language
- Check reading ease (Flesch-Kincaid)

### Tone

**Effective**: Respectful, direct, encouraging
**Avoid**: Patronizing, overly formal, condescending

**Good**: "Think about what you know about particles"
**Bad**: "You learned in Year 7 that particles..."
**Bad**: "This simple question asks you to..."

### Question Length

**Optimal**: 2-4 sentences for stem
**Maximum**: 6-8 sentences with clear structure
**Complex questions**: Break into parts

## Content Relevance

### What Matters to Adolescents

| Interest Area | Connection to Science |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Social media/tech | Energy, data, devices |
| Sports/fitness | Energy, body systems |
| Environment | Chemistry, ecosystems |
| Gaming | Physics, problem-solving |
| Music | Sound waves, energy |
| Food | Chemistry, nutrition |

### Making Content Relevant

**Strategies**:
1. Use authentic contexts
2. Connect to current events
3. Show career applications
4. Reference technology they use
5. Link to their experiences

**Example Transformation**:
```
❌ Generic: "A gas fills its container"
✓ Relevant: "When you spray deodorant, it spreads
   throughout the bathroom. Explain why using
   what you know about gas particles."
```

## Year Level Expectations (Year 8 - Age 13-14)

### NSW Curriculum Alignment

**Stage 4**: Years 7-8
- Building scientific understanding
- Developing inquiry skills
- Connecting concepts across topics

### Content Complexity

| Aspect | Year 8 Expectation |
|--------|-------------------|
| Concepts | Multiple related concepts |
| Abstraction | Concrete → abstract with support |
| Independence | Scaffolded problem-solving |
| Vocabulary | Academic science vocabulary |
| Mathematics | Basic algebra, ratios |

### Question Expectations

**Should Include**:
- Clear structure
- Age-appropriate scenarios
- Scaffolding available
- Building on Year 7

**Can Challenge With**:
- Application to new contexts
- Connecting multiple concepts
- Explaining reasoning
- Predicting outcomes

**Should Avoid**:
- Year 9+ vocabulary without definition
- Assumed knowledge from Year 9+
- Excessive abstraction without concrete anchors
- Dense text without structure

## Design Checklist for Year 8
