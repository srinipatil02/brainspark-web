## Rich Content in Solutions

### Equations
```markdown
The kinetic energy of particles is related to temperature:

$$KE_{avg} \propto T$$

This means as temperature increases, particles move faster.
```

### Tables for Comparison
```markdown
| Property | Solid | Liquid | Gas |
|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| Shape | Fixed | Container | Container |
| Volume | Fixed | Fixed | Fills space |
| Particle spacing | Very close | Close | Far apart |
| Particle movement | Vibrate | Slide past | Move freely |
```

### Diagrams (Text Description)
```markdown
**Particle Diagram:**
```
Solid:      Liquid:     Gas:
●●●●●●      ●●● ●       ●    ●
●●●●●●      ● ●●●       ●  ●
●●●●●●       ●●● ●         ●  ●

## Examples by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Build Understanding)
```markdown
**Question:** Name the three states of matter.

**Solution:**

The three states of matter are:
1. **Solid** - has a fixed shape and fixed volume
2. **Liquid** - has no fixed shape but has a fixed volume
3. **Gas** - has no fixed shape and no fixed volume

**Key concept:** All matter exists in one of these three states, depending on
the energy of its particles.
```

### Phase 2: Application (Apply to Context)
```markdown
**Question:** Explain why you can pour water from a jug but not ice cubes.

**Solution:**

Water can be poured because its particles can move past each other. In a liquid:
- Particles are close together but not fixed in position
- They can slide over one another
- This allows the liquid to flow and take the shape of its container

Ice cannot be poured because its particles are fixed in position. In a solid:
- Particles are held in a rigid, regular pattern
- They can only vibrate, not move to new positions
- This means the solid keeps its shape

**Key concept:** The ability to flow depends on whether particles can move
past each other (liquids and gases) or are fixed in place (solids).

**Scientific vocabulary:**
- **Fluid**: A substance that can flow (liquids and gases)
- **Viscosity**: How easily a liquid flows (not required for this answer)
```

### Phase 3: Connection (Link Multiple Ideas)
```markdown
**Question:** Using the particle model, explain why ice floats in water.

**Solution:**

Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water. This is unusual
for a solid.

**Particle explanation:**
1. In most solids, particles pack more closely than in liquids, making
   solids denser
2. Water is different: when it freezes, particles form a special crystal
   structure with gaps
3. These gaps make ice take up MORE space than the same mass of liquid water
4. More space = lower density = floats

**Why this matters:**
- If ice sank, lakes would freeze from the bottom up
- Fish and other organisms would not survive winter
- Earth's climate would be dramatically different

**Key concept:** Water's unusual density behaviour is due to the unique
way water molecules arrange when they freeze.

**Common mistake:** Don't say "ice has less mass" - ice floats because
of lower DENSITY (mass per unit volume), not less mass.
```

### Phase 4: Mastery (Full Integration)
```markdown
**Question:** A student claims: "Cold makes particles stop moving."
Evaluate this claim using your knowledge of particle theory.

**Solution:**

**Evaluation:** The claim is incorrect. Here's why:

**What's wrong:**
- Particles ALWAYS move, at any temperature above absolute zero (−273°C)
- "Cold" doesn't add something to particles—it just means less heat energy
- Even in the coldest environments on Earth, particles still have motion

**What actually happens:**
1. As temperature decreases, particles lose kinetic energy
2. They move more slowly (but don't stop)
3. This is why solids form—particles move slowly enough to stay in fixed positions
4. Only at absolute zero (theoretically) would all motion cease, but this temperature cannot be reached

**The misconception source:**
Students often think "cold" is a thing (like heat is a thing). Actually,
cold is just the absence of heat energy. Particles respond to having less
energy by moving more slowly, not by stopping.

**Scientific principle:** Temperature is a measure of average kinetic
energy of particles. Lower temperature = slower particle motion,
but motion continues until absolute zero.

**Key concept:** All particles above absolute zero have kinetic energy
and are in constant motion. Temperature affects speed, not presence,
of motion.
